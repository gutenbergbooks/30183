<blockquote>
<p>This MANUAL OF THE ART OF FICTION
is a revised and amplified edition of
&ldquo;Materials and Methods of Fiction,&rdquo;
by Clayton Hamilton, which was first
published in 1908. The earlier work was
immediately recognized as an important
piece of constructive criticism and has held
its position ever since as one of the leading
books in its field. On the tenth anniversary
of its appearance, the publishers have
asked the author to prepare this annotated

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</div>
<p>In our time, in these early years of the twentieth
century, the novel is the prosperous parvenu of literature,
and only a few of those who acknowledge its vogue and
who laud its success take the trouble to recall its humble
beginnings and the miseries of its youth. But like other
parvenus it is still a little uncertain of its position in the
society in which it moves. It is a newcomer in the literary
world; and it has the self-assertiveness and the touchiness
natural to the situation. It brags of its descent,
although its origins are obscure. It has won its way to
the front and it has forced its admission into circles where
it was formerly denied access. It likes to forget that it
was once but little better than an outcast, unworthy
of recognition from those in authority. Perhaps it is
still uneasily conscious that not a few of those who were
born to good society may look at it with cold suspicion
as though it was still on sufferance.</p>
<p>Story-telling has always been popular, of course; and
the desire is deep-rooted in all of us to hear and to tell
some new thing and to tell again something deserving
remembrance. But the novel itself, and the short-story
also, must confess that they have only of late been able
to claim equality with the epic and the lyric, and with
comedy and tragedy, literary forms consecrated by antiquity.
There were nine Muses in Greece of old, and
no one of these daughters of Apollo was expected to inspire
the writer of prose-fiction. Whoever had then a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiv' name='page_xiv'></a>xiv</span>
story to tell, which he wished to treat artistically, never
dreamed of expressing it except in the nobler medium
of verse, in the epic, in the idyl, in the drama. Prose
seemed to the Greeks, and even to the Latins who followed
in their footsteps, as fit only for pedestrian purposes.
Even oratory and history were almost rhythmic;
and mere prose was too humble an instrument for those
whom the Muses cherished. The Alexandrian vignettes
of the gentle Theocritus may be regarded as anticipations
of the modern short-story of urban local color; but this
delicate idyllist used verse for the talk of his Tanagra
figurines.</p>
<p>Even when the modern languages entered into the
inheritance of Latin and Greek, verse held to its ancestral
privileges, and the brief tale took the form of the
ballad, and the longer narrative called itself a <i>chanson
de geste</i>. Boccaccio and Rabelais and Cervantes might
win immediate popularity and invite a host of imitators;
but it was long after their time before a tale in prose,
whether short or long, achieved recognition as worthy
of serious critical consideration. In his study of Balzac,
Bruneti&egrave;re recorded the significant fact that no novelist,
who was purely and simply a novelist, was elected to the
French Academy in the first two centuries of its existence.
And the same acute critic, in his &ldquo;History of Classical
French Literature,&rdquo; pointed out that French novels were
under a cloud of suspicion even so far back as the days
of Erasmus, in 1525. It was many scores of years thereafter
before the self-appointed guardians of French
literature esteemed the novel highly enough to condescend
to discuss it.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was not altogether a disadvantage.
French tragedy was discussed only too abundantly; and
the theorists laid down rules for it which were not a
little cramping. Another French critic, M. Le Breton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xv' name='page_xv'></a>xv</span>
in his account of the growth of French prose-fiction in
the first half of the nineteenth century, has asserted that
this exemption from criticism really redounded to the
benefit of the novel, since the despised form was allowed
to develop naturally, spontaneously, free from all the
many artificial restrictions which the dogmatists succeeded
in imposing on tragedy and on comedy, and which
resulted at last in the sterility of the French drama
toward the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning
of the nineteenth. While this advantage is undeniable,
one may question whether it was not bought
at too great a price and whether there would not have
been a certain profit for prose-fiction if its practitioners
had been kept up to the mark by a criticism which educated
the public to demand greater care in structure,
more logic in the conduct of events, and stricter veracity
in the treatment of characters.</p>
<p>However much it might then be deemed unworthy of
serious consideration, the novel in the eighteenth century
began to attract to itself more and more authors of rich
natural endowment. In English literature especially,
prose-fiction tempted men as unlike as Defoe and Swift,
Richardson and Fielding, Smollett and Sterne, Goldsmith
and Johnson. And a little earlier the eighteenth century
essayists, with Steele and Addison at the head of them,
had developed the art of character-delineation, a development
out of which the novelists were to make their profit.
The influence of the English eighteenth-century essay on
the growth of prose-fiction, not only in the British Isles,
but also on the continent of Europe, is larger than is
generally admitted. Indeed, there is a sense in which
the successive papers depicting the character and the
deeds of Sir Roger de Coverley may be accepted as the
earliest of serial stories.</p>
<p>But it was only in the nineteenth century that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvi' name='page_xvi'></a>xvi</span>
novel reached its full expansion and succeeded in winning
recognition as the heir of the epic and the rival of the
drama. This victory was the direct result of the overwhelming
success of the Waverley novels and of the
countless stories written more or less in accordance with
Scott&rsquo;s formula, by Cooper, by Victor Hugo and Dumas,
by Manzoni, and by all the others who followed in their
footsteps in every modern language. Not only born
story-tellers but writers who were by natural gift poets
or dramatists, seized upon the novel as a form in which
they could express themselves freely and by which they
might hope to gain a proper reward in money as well as
in fame. The economic interpretation of literary history
has not received the attention it deserves; and the future
investigator will find a rich field in his researches for the
causes of the expansion of the novel in the nineteenth
century simultaneous with the decline of the drama in
the literature of almost every modern language except
French.</p>
<p>As the nineteenth century drew toward its maturity,
the influence of Balzac reinforced the influence of Scott;
and realism began to assert its right to substitute itself
for romance. The adjustment of character to its appropriate
background, the closer connection of fiction with
the actual facts of life, the focussing of attention on the
normal and the usual rather than on the abnormal and
the exceptional&ndash;&ndash;all these steps in advance were more
easily taken in the freer form of the novel than they could
be in the more restricted formula of the drama; and for
the first time in its history prose-fiction found itself a
pioneer, achieving a solidity of texture which the theatre
had not yet been able to attain.</p>
<p>The novel revealed itself at last as a fit instrument for
applied psychology, for the use of those delicate artists
who are interested rather in what character is than in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvii' name='page_xvii'></a>xvii</span>
what it may chance to do. In the earliest fictions,
whether in prose or verse, the hero had been merely a
type, little more than a lay-figure capable of violent
attitudes, a doer of deeds who, as Professor Gummere has
explained, &ldquo;answered the desire for poetic expression at
a time when an individual is merged in the clan.&rdquo; And
as the realistic writers perfected their art, the more acute
readers began to perceive that the hero who is a doer of
deeds can represent only the earlier stages of culture
which we have long outgrown. This hero came to be
recognized as an anachronism, out of place in a more
modern social organization based on a full appreciation
of individuality. He was too much a type and too little
an individual to satisfy the demands of those who looked
to literature as the mirror of life itself and who had
taught themselves to relish what Lowell terms the &ldquo;punctilious
veracity which gives to a portrait its whole worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was only in the middle years of the nineteenth
century, after Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert, after
Thackeray and George Eliot, and Hawthorne, that the
novel found out its true field. And yet it was in the
middle years of the seventeenth century that the ideal
to which it was aspiring had been proclaimed frankly by
the forgotten Fureti&egrave;re in the preface to his &ldquo;Roman
Bourgeois.&rdquo; Fureti&egrave;re lacked the skill and the insight
needful for the satisfactory attainment of the standard
he set up&ndash;&ndash;indeed, the attainment of that standard is
beyond the power of most novelists even now. But
Fureti&egrave;re&rsquo;s declaration of the principles which he proposed
to follow is as significant now as it was in 1666,
when neither the writer himself nor the reader to whom
he had to appeal was ripe for the advance which he
insisted upon. &ldquo;I shall tell you,&rdquo; said Fureti&egrave;re, &ldquo;sincerely
and faithfully, several stories or adventures which
happened to persons who are neither heroes nor heroines,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xviii' name='page_xviii'></a>xviii</span>
who will raise no armies and overthrow no kingdoms,
but who will be honest folk of mediocre condition, and
who will quietly make their way. Some of them will be
good-looking and others ugly. Some of them will be
wise and others foolish; and these last, in fact, seem likely
to prove the larger number.&rdquo;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:larger;'>II</p>
<p>The novel had a long road to travel before it became
possible for novelists to approach the ideal that Fureti&egrave;re
proclaimed and before they had acquired the skill needed
to make their readers accept it. And there had also to
be a slow development of our own ideas concerning the
relation of art to life. For one thing, art had been expected
to emphasize a moral; there was even a demand
on the drama to be overtly didactic. Less than a score
of years after Fureti&egrave;re&rsquo;s preface there was published
an English translation of the Abb&eacute; d&rsquo;Aubignac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pratique
du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre&rdquo; which was entitled the &ldquo;Whole Art of
the Stage&rdquo; and in which the theory of &ldquo;poetic justice&rdquo;
was set forth formally. &ldquo;One of the chiefest, and indeed
the most indispensable Rule of Drammatick Poems is
that in them Virtues always ought to be rewarded, or at
least commended, in spite of all the Injuries of Fortune;
and that likewise Vices be always punished or at least
detested with Horrour, though they triumph upon the
Stage for that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johnson was so completely a man of his own
century that he found fault with Shakespeare because
Shakespeare did not preach, because in the great tragedies
virtue is not always rewarded and vice is not always
punished. Doctor Johnson and the Abb&eacute; d&rsquo;Aubignac
wanted the dramatist to be false to life as we all know it.
Beyond all peradventure the wages of sin is death; and
yet we have all seen the evil-doer dying in the midst of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xix' name='page_xix'></a>xix</span>
his devoted family and surrounded by all the external
evidences of worldly success. To insist that virtue shall
be outwardly triumphant at the end of a play or of a novel
is to require the dramatist or the novelist to falsify. It is
to introduce an element of unreality into fiction. It is to
require the story-teller and the playmaker to prove a
thesis that common sense must reject.</p>
<p>Any attempt to require the artist to prove anything is
necessarily cramping. A true representation of life does
not prove one thing only, it proves many things. Life
is large, unlimited, and incessant; and the lessons of the
finest art are those of life itself; they are not single but
multiple. Who can declare what is the single moral contained
in the &ldquo;&OElig;dipus&rdquo; of Sophocles, the &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; of
Shakespeare, the &ldquo;Tartufe&rdquo; of Moli&egrave;re? No two spectators
of these masterpieces would agree on the special
morals to be isolated; and yet none of them would deny
that the masterpieces are profoundly moral because of
their essential truth. Morality, a specific moral&ndash;&ndash;this
is what the artist cannot deliberately put into his work
without destroying its veracity. But morality is also
what he cannot leave out if he has striven only to handle
his subject sincerely. Hegel is right when he tells us
that art has its moral&ndash;&ndash;but the moral depends on him
who draws it. The didactic drama and the novel-with-a-purpose
are necessarily unartistic and unavoidably
unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>This is what the greater artists have always felt; this
is what they have often expressed unhesitatingly. Corneille,
for one, though he was a man of his time, a creature
of the seventeenth century, had the courage to
assert that &ldquo;the utility of a play is seen in the simple
depicting of vices and virtues, which never fails to be
effective if it is well done and if the traits are so recognizable
that they cannot be confounded or mistaken; virtue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xx' name='page_xx'></a>xx</span>
always gets itself loved, however unfortunate, and vice
gets itself hated, even though triumphant.&rdquo; Dryden,
again, a contemporary of d&rsquo;Aubignac and a predecessor
of Johnson, had a clearer vision than either of them; and
his views are far in advance of theirs. &ldquo;Delight,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;is the chief if not the only end of poesy,&rdquo; and by
poesy he meant fiction in all its forms; &ldquo;instruction can
be admitted but in the second place, for poetry only instructs
as it delights.&rdquo; And once more, when we pass
from the seventeenth century of Corneille and Dryden
to the nineteenth century when the novel has asserted
its rivalry with the drama, we find the wise Goethe declaring
to Eckermann the doctrine which is now winning acceptance
everywhere. &ldquo;If there is a moral in the subject
it will appear, and the poet has nothing to consider but
the effective and artistic treatment of his subject; if he
has as high a soul as Sophocles, his influence will always
be moral, let him do what he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A high soul is not given to all writers of fiction, and
yet there is an obligation on them all to aspire to the
praise bestowed on Sophocles as one who &ldquo;saw life
steadily and saw it whole.&rdquo; Even the humblest of story-tellers
ought to feel himself bound, not to preach, not to
point a moral ostentatiously, not to warp the march of
events for the sake of so-called &ldquo;poetic justice,&rdquo; but to
report life as he knows it, making it neither better nor
worse, to represent it honestly, to tell the truth about it
and nothing but the truth, even if he does not tell the
whole truth&ndash;&ndash;which is given to no man to know. This is
an obligation that not a few of the foremost writers of
fiction have failed to respect. Dickens, for example, is
delighted to reform a character in the twinkling of an
eye, transforming a bad man into a good man over
night, and contradicting all that we know about the
permanence of character.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxi' name='page_xxi'></a>xxi</span></div>
<p>Other novelists have asked us to admire violent and
unexpected acts of startling self-sacrifice, when a character
is made to take on himself the responsibility for the
delinquency of some other character. They have invited
our approbation for a moral suicide, which is quite
as blameworthy as any physical suicide. With his keen
insight into ethics and with his robust common sense,
Huxley stated the principle which these novelists have
failed to grasp. A man, he tells us, &ldquo;may refuse to commit
another, but he ought not to allow himself to be believed
worse than he actually is,&rdquo; since this results in &ldquo;a
loss to the world of moral force which cannot be afforded.&rdquo;
The final test of the fineness of fiction lies in its
veracity. &ldquo;Romance is the poetry of circumstance,&rdquo; as
Stevenson tells us, and &ldquo;drama is the poetry of conduct&rdquo;;
we may be tolerant and easy-going in our acceptance of a
novelist&rsquo;s circumstances, but we ought to be rigorous as
regards conduct. As far as the successive happenings
of his story are concerned, the mere incidents, the author
may on occasion ask our indulgence and tax our credulity
a little; but he must not expect us to forgive him for any
violation of the fundamental truths of human nature.</p>
<p>It is this stern veracity, unflinching and inexorable,
which makes &ldquo;Anna Kar&eacute;nina&rdquo; one of the noblest works
of art that the nineteenth century devised to the twentieth,
just as it is the absence of this fidelity to the facts of
life, the twisting of character to prove a thesis, which
vitiates the &ldquo;Kreutzer Sonata,&rdquo; and makes it unworthy
of the great artist in fiction who wrote the earlier work.
It is not too much to say that the development of
Tolstoi as a militant moralist is coincident with his decline
as an artist. He is no longer content to picture life
as he sees it; he insists on preaching. And when he uses
his art, not as an end in itself, but as an instrument to
advocate his own individual theories, although his great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxii' name='page_xxii'></a>xxii</span>
gifts are not taken from him, the result is that his later
novels lack the broad and deep moral effect which gave
his earlier studies of life and character their abiding
value.</p>
<p>Stevenson had in him &ldquo;something of the shorter catechist&rdquo;;
and the Scotch artist in letters, enamored of words
as he was, seized firmly the indispensable law. &ldquo;The
most influential books, and the truest in their influence,
are works of fiction,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;They do not pin
their reader to a dogma, which he must afterward discover
to be inexact; they do not teach a lesson, which he
must afterward unlearn. They repeat, they rearrange,
they clarify the lessons of life; they disengage us from
ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintances of
others, and they show us the web of experience not as
we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change&ndash;&ndash;that
monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the
nonce, struck out. To be so, they must be reasonably
true to the human comedy; and any work that is so
serves the turn of instruction.&rdquo; This is well thought and
well put, although many of us might demand that novels
should be more than &ldquo;reasonably true.&rdquo; But even if
Stevenson was here a little lax in the requirements he
imposed on others, he was stricter with himself when he
wrote &ldquo;Markheim&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another story-teller, also cut off before he had displayed
the best that was in him, set up the same standards
for his fellow-craftsmen in fiction. In his striking
discussion of the responsibility of the novelist, Frank
Norris asserted that the readers of fiction have &ldquo;a right
to the Truth as they have a right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. It is <i>not</i> right that they be exploited
and deceived with false views of life, false characters,
false sentiment, false morality, false history, false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxiii' name='page_xxiii'></a>xxiii</span>
philosophy, false emotions, false heroism, false notions
of self-sacrifice, false views of religion, of duty, of conduct,
and of manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:larger;'>III</p>
<p>Even if there may have been a certain advantage to
the novel, as M. Le Breton maintains, because it was
long left alone unfettered by any critical code, to expand
as best it could, to find its own way unaided and to work
out its own salvation, the time has now come when it
may profit by a criticism which shall force it to consider
its responsibilities and to appraise its technical resources,
if it is to claim artistic equality with the drama and the
epic. It has won its way to the front; and there are few
who now question its right to the position it has attained.
There is no denying that in English literature, in the age
of Victoria, the novel established itself as the literary
form most alluring to all men of letters and that it succeeded
to the place held by the essay in the days of Anne
and by the play in the days of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>And like the play and the essay in those earlier times,
the novel now attracts writers who have no great natural
gift for the form. Just as Peele and Greene wrote plays
because play-writing was popular and advantageous, in
spite of their inadequate dramaturgic equipment, and
just as Johnson wrote essays because essay-writing was
popular and advantageous in spite of his deficiency in
the ease and lightness which the essay demands, so
Brougham and Motley and Froude adventured themselves
in fiction. We may even doubt whether George
Eliot was a born story-teller and whether she would not
have been more successful in some other epoch when
some other literary form than the novel had happened to
be in fashion. In France the novel tempted Victor Hugo,
who was essentially a lyric poet, and the elder Dumas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxiv' name='page_xxiv'></a>xxiv</span>
who was essentially a playwright. There are not lacking
signs of late that the drama is likely in the immediate
future to assert a sharper rivalry with prose-fiction;
and novelists like Sir James Barrie and the late Paul
Hervieu have relinquished the easier narrative for the
more difficult and more dangerous stage-play. But there
is no evidence that the novel is soon to lose its vogue.
It has come to stay; and as the nineteenth century left
it to the twentieth so the twentieth will probably bequeath
it to the twenty-first unimpaired in prosperity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best evidence of the solidity of its position
is to be found in the critical consideration which it is at
last receiving. Histories of fiction in all literatures and
biographies of the novelists in all languages are multiplying
abundantly. We are beginning to take our fiction
seriously and to inquire into its principles. Long ago
Freytag&rsquo;s &ldquo;Technic of the Drama&rdquo; was followed by
Spielhagen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Technic of the Novel,&rdquo; rather Teutonically
philosophic, both of them, and already a little out
of date. Studies of prose-fiction are getting themselves
written, none of them more illuminative than Professor
Bliss Perry&rsquo;s. The novelists themselves are writing about
the art of fiction, as Sir Walter Besant did, and they are
asking what the novel is, as the late Marion Crawford has
done. They are beginning to resent the assertion of the
loyal adherents of the drama, that the novel is too loose
a form to call forth the best efforts of the artist, and that
a play demands at least technical skill whereas a novel
may be often the product of unskilled labor.</p>
<p>Questions of all kinds are presenting themselves for
discussion. Has the rise of realism made romance impossible?
Is there a valid distinction between romance
and romanticism? Is the short-story a definite form,
differing from the novel in purpose as well as in length?
What is the best way to tell a story&ndash;&ndash;in the third person,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxv' name='page_xxv'></a>xxv</span>
as in the epic&ndash;&ndash;in the first person, as in an autobiography&ndash;&ndash;or
in letters? Which is of most importance, character
or incident or atmosphere? Is the novel-with-a-purpose
legitimate? Why is it that dramatized novels often fail
in the theatre? Ought a novelist to take sides with his
characters and against them, or ought he to suppress his
own opinions and remain impassive, as the dramatist
must? Does a prodigality in the invention of incidents
reveal a greater imagination in the novelist than is required
for the sincere depicting of simple characters in
every-day life? Why has the old trick of inserting brief
tales inside a long novel&ndash;&ndash;such as we find in &ldquo;Don
Quixote&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tom Jones&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;been
abandoned of late years? How far is a novelist
justified in taking his characters so closely from actual
life that they are recognizable by his readers? What are
the advantages and disadvantages of local color? How
much dialect may a novelist venture to employ? Is the
historical novel really a loftier type of fiction than the
novel of contemporary life? Is it really possible to write
a veracious novel about any other than the novelist&rsquo;s
native land? Why is it that so many of the greater
writers of fiction have brought forth their first novel only
after they had attained to half the allotted three score
years and ten? Is the scientific spirit going to be helpful
or harmful to the writer of fiction? Which is the finer
form for fiction, a swift and direct telling of the story,
with the concentration of a Greek tragedy, such as we
find in the &ldquo;Scarlet Letter&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Smoke,&rdquo; or an
ampler and more leisurely movement more like that of
the Elizabethan plays, such as we may see in &ldquo;Vanity
Fair&rdquo; and in &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo;?</p>
<p>These questions, and many another, we may expect
to hear discussed, even if they cannot all of them be answered,
in any consideration of the materials and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xxvi' name='page_xxvi'></a>xxvi</span>
methods of fiction. And the result of these inquiries
cannot fail to be beneficial, both to the writer of fiction
and to the reader of fiction. To the story-teller himself
they will serve as a stimulus and a guide, calling attention
to the technic of his craft and broadening his knowledge
of the principles of his art. To the idle reader even
they ought to be helpful, because they will force him to
think about the novels he may read and because they
will lead him to be more exacting, to insist more on
veracity in the portrayal of life, and to demand more care
in the method of presentation. Every art profits by a
wider understanding of its principles, of its possibilities
and of its limitations, as well as by a more diffused
knowledge of its technic.</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>Postscript</span>: It is a good sign for the future of the
novel that in the ten years which have elapsed since this
introduction was written, the professors of literature in
our colleges and in our graduate schools have been paying
increased attention to the study of prose fiction. They
had, first of all, to inform themselves more abundantly
as to its past history, and as to the relation it has borne
to the epic on the one hand and to the drama on the
other. Then, secondly, they have been encouraged to
pass on to the students they were guiding the results
of their researches and of their reflections. And as a
result the significance of the novel is day by day made
more manifest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Fiction a Means of Telling Truth.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Before we set
out upon a study of the materials and methods of
fiction, we must be certain that we appreciate the
purpose of the art and understand its relation to the
other arts and sciences. <i>The purpose of fiction is to
embody certain truths of human life in a series of imagined
facts.</i> The importance of this purpose is scarcely ever
appreciated by the casual careless reader of the novels of
a season. Although it is commonly believed that such
a reader overestimates the weight of works of fiction,
the opposite is true&ndash;&ndash;he underestimates it. Every
novelist of genuine importance seeks not merely to
divert but also to instruct&ndash;&ndash;to instruct, not abstractly,
like the essayist, but concretely, by presenting to the
reader characters and actions which are true. For the
best fiction, although it deals with the lives of imaginary
people, is no less true than the best history and biography,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
which record actual facts of human life; and it
is more true than such careless reports of actual occurrences
as are published in the daily newspapers. The
truth of worthy fiction is evidenced by the honor in
which it has been held in all ages among all races. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t fool all the people all the time&rdquo;; and if the drama
and the epic and the novel were not true, the human race
would have rejected them many centuries ago. Fiction
has survived, and flourishes to-day, because it is a means
of telling truth.</p>
<p><b>Fact and Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is only in the vocabulary
of very careless thinkers that the words <i>truth</i> and <i>fiction</i>
are regarded as antithetic. A genuine antithesis subsists
between the words <i>fact</i> and <i>fiction</i>; but <i>fact</i> and <i>truth</i> are
not synonymous. The novelist forsakes the realm of
fact in order that he may better tell the truth, and
lures the reader away from actualities in order to present
him with realities. It is of prime importance, in our
present study, therefore, that we should understand at
the very outset the relation between fact and truth, the
distinction between the actual and the real.</p>
<p><b>Truth and Fact.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A fact is a specific manifestation of
a general law: this general law is the truth because of
which that fact has come to be. It is a fact that when
an apple-tree is shaken by the wind, such apples as may
be loosened from their twigs fall to the ground: it is a
truth that bodies in space attract each other with a
force that varies inversely as the square of the distance
between them. Fact is concrete, and is a matter of
physical experience: truth is abstract, and is a matter of
mental theory. Actuality is the realm of fact, reality
the realm of truth. The universe as we apprehend it
with our senses is actual; the laws of the universe as we
comprehend them with our understanding are real.</p>
<p><b>The Search for Truth.</b>&ndash;&ndash;All human science is an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
endeavor to discover the truths which underlie the
facts that we perceive: all human philosophy is an
endeavor to understand and to appraise those truths
when once they are discovered: and all human art is an
endeavor to utter them clearly and effectively when
once they are appraised and understood. The history
of man is the history of a constant and continuous
seeking for the truth. Amazed before a universe of facts,
he has striven earnestly to discover the truth which
underlies them&ndash;&ndash;striven heroically to understand the
large reality of which the actual is but a sensuously perceptible
embodiment. In the earliest centuries of recorded
thought the search was unmethodical; truth was
apprehended, if at all, by intuition, and announced as
dogma: but in modern centuries certain regular methods
have been devised to guide the search. The modern
scientist begins his work by collecting a large number of
apparently related facts and arranging them in an
orderly manner. He then proceeds to induce from the
observation of these facts an apprehension of the general
law that explains their relation. This hypothesis is then
tested in the light of further facts, until it seems so incontestable
that the minds of men accept it as the truth.
The scientist then formulates it in an abstract theoretic
statement, and thus concludes his work.</p>
<p>But it is at just this point that the philosopher begins.
Accepting many truths from many scientists, the philosopher
compares, reconciles, and correlates them, and
thus builds out of them a structure of belief. But this
structure of belief remains abstract and theoretic in the
mind of the philosopher. It is now the artist&rsquo;s turn.
Accepting the correlated theoretic truths which the
scientist and the philosopher have given him, he endows
them with an imaginative embodiment perceptible to
the senses. He translates them back into concrete
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
terms; he clothes them in invented facts; he makes them
imaginatively perceptible to a mind native and indued
to actuality; and thus he gives expression to the truth.</p>
<p><b>The Necessary Triple Process.</b>&ndash;&ndash;This triple process
of the scientific discovery, the philosophic understanding,
and the artistic expression of truth has been
explained at length, because every great writer of fiction
must pass through the entire mental process. The
fiction-writer differs from other seekers for the truth,
not in the method of his thought, but merely in its
subject-matter. His theme is human life. It is some
truth of human life that he endeavors to discover, to
understand, and to announce; and in order to complete
his work, he must apply to human life an attention of
thought which is successively scientific, philosophic, and
artistic. He must first observe carefully certain facts of
actual life, study them in the light of extended experience,
and induce from them the general laws which he deems
to be the truths which underlie them. In doing this, he
is a scientist. Next, if he be a great thinker, he will
correlate these truths and build out of them a structure
of belief. In doing this, he is a philosopher. Lastly, he
must create imaginatively such scenes and characters
as will illustrate the truths he has discovered and considered,
and will convey them clearly and effectively to
the minds of his readers. In doing this, he is an artist.</p>
<p><b>Different Degrees of Emphasis.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But although this
triple mental process (of scientific discovery, philosophic
understanding, and artistic expression) is experienced in
full by every master of fiction, we find that certain
authors are interested most in the first, or scientific
phase of the process, others in the second, or philosophic
phase, and still others in the third, or artistic phase.
Evidently Emile Zola is interested chiefly in a scientific
investigation of the actual facts of life, George Eliot in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
philosophic contemplation of its underlying truths, and
Gabriele D&rsquo;Annunzio in an artistic presentation of the
dream-world that he imagines. Washington Irving is
mainly an artist, Tolstoi mainly a philosopher, and Jane
Austen mainly a scientifically accurate observer. Few
are the writers, even among the greatest masters of the
art, of whom we feel, as we feel of Hawthorne, that the
scientist, the philosopher, and the artist reign over equal
precincts of their minds. Hawthorne the scientist is so
thorough, so accurate, and so precise in his investigations
of provincial life that no less a critic than James Russell
Lowell declared the &ldquo;House of the Seven Gables&rdquo; to be
&ldquo;the most valuable contribution to New England
history that has yet been made.&rdquo; Hawthorne the
philosopher is so wise in his understanding of crime and
retribution, so firm in his structure of belief concerning
moral truth, that it seems that he, if any one, might
give an answer to that poignant cry of a despairing
murderer,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>

<p>And Hawthorne the artist is so delicate in his sensitive
and loving presentation of the beautiful, so masterly
both in structure and in style, that his work, in artistry
alone, is its own excuse for being. Were it not for the
<i>confinement</i> of his fiction&ndash;&ndash;its lack of range and sweep,
both in subject-matter and in attitude of mind&ndash;&ndash;his work
on this account might be regarded as an illustration of
all that may be great in the threefold process of creation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p><b>The Art of Fiction and the Craft of Chemistry.</b>&ndash;&ndash;<i>Fiction</i>,
to borrow a figure from chemical science, <i>is life
distilled</i>. In the author&rsquo;s mind, the actual is first evaporated
to the real, and the real is then condensed to the
imagined. The author first transmutes the concrete
actualities of life into abstract realities; and then he
transmutes these abstract realities into concrete imaginings.
Necessarily, if he has pursued this mental process
without a fallacy, his imaginings will be true; because
they represent realities, which in turn have been induced
from actualities.</p>
<p><b>Fiction and Reality.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In one of his criticisms of the
greatest modern dramatist, Mr. William Archer has
called attention to the fact that &ldquo;habitually and instinctively
men pay to Ibsen the compliment (so often
paid to Shakespeare) of discussing certain of his female
characters as though they were real women, living lives
apart from the poet&rsquo;s creative intelligence.&rdquo; [It is
evident that Mr. Archer, in saying &ldquo;real women,&rdquo;
means what is more precisely denoted by the words
&ldquo;actual women.&rdquo;] Such a compliment is also paid
instinctively to every master of the art of fiction; and the
reason is not hard to understand. If the general laws of
life which the novelist has thought out be true laws, and
if his imaginative embodiment of them be at all points
thoroughly consistent, his characters will be true men
and women in the highest sense. They will not be
actual, but they will be real. The great characters of
fiction&ndash;&ndash;Sir Willoughby Patterne, Tito Melema, D&rsquo;Artagnan,
P&egrave;re Grandet, Rosalind, Tartufe, Hamlet,
Ulysses&ndash;&ndash;embody truths of human life that have been
arrived at only after thorough observation of facts and
patient induction from them. Cervantes must have
observed a multitude of dreamers before he learned the
truth of the idealist&rsquo;s character which he has expressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
in Don Quixote. The great people of fiction are typical
of large classes of mankind. They live more truly than
do you and I, because they are made of us and of many
men besides. They have the large reality of general
ideas, which is a truer thing than the actuality of facts.
This is why we know them and think of them as real
people&ndash;&ndash;old acquaintances whom we knew (perhaps)
before we were born, when (as is conceivable) we lived
with them in Plato&rsquo;s Realm of Ideas. In France, instead
of calling a man a miser, they call him an Harpagon. We
know Rosalind as we know our sweetest summer love;
Hamlet is our elder brother, and understands our own
wavering and faltering.</p>
<p><b>Fiction and History.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Instinctively also we regard
the great people of fiction as more real than many of
the actual people of a bygone age whose deeds are
chronicled in dusty histories. To a modern mind, if you
conjure with the name of Marcus Brutus, you will
start the spirit of Shakespeare&rsquo;s fictitious patriot, not
of the actual Brutus, of a very different nature, whose
doings are dimly reported by the chroniclers of Rome.
The Richelieu of Dumas p&egrave;re may bear but slight
resemblance to the actual founder of the French
Academy; but he lives for us more really than the
Richelieu of many histories. We know Hamlet even
better than we know Henri-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Amiel, who in many
ways was like him; even though Amiel has reported himself
more thoroughly than almost any other actual man.
We may go a step further and declare that the actual
people of any age can live in the memory of after ages
only when the facts of their characters and their careers
have been transmuted into a sort of fiction by the minds
of creative historians. Actually, in 1815, there was but
one Napoleon; now there are as many Napoleons as
there are biographies and histories of him. He has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
recreated in one way by one author, in another by
another; and you may take your choice. You may
accept the Julius C&aelig;sar of Mr. Bernard Shaw, or the
Julius C&aelig;sar of Thomas De Quincey. The first is
frankly fiction; and the second, not so frankly, is fiction
also&ndash;&ndash;just as far from actuality as Shakespeare&rsquo;s adaptation
of Plutarch&rsquo;s portraiture.</p>
<p><b>Fiction and Biography.</b>&ndash;&ndash;One of the most vivid
illustrations of how a great creative mind, honestly seeking
to discover, to understand, and to express the truth
concerning actual characters of the past, necessarily
makes fiction of those characters, is given by Thomas
Carlyle in his &ldquo;Heroes and Hero-Worship.&rdquo; Here, in
Carlyle&rsquo;s method of procedure, it is easy to discern that
threefold process of creation which is undergone by the
fiction-making mind. An examination of recorded facts
concerning Mohammed, Dante, Luther, or Burns leads
him to a discovery and a formulation of certain abstract
truths concerning the Hero as Prophet, as Poet, as
Priest, or as Man of Letters; and thereafter, in composing
his historical studies, he sets forth only such actual
facts as conform with his philosophic understanding of
the truth and will therefore represent this understanding
with the utmost emphasis. He makes fiction of his
heroes, in order most emphatically to tell the truth
about them.</p>
<p><b>Biography, History, and Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In this way
biography and history at their best are doomed to employ
the methods of the art of fiction; and we can therefore
understand without surprise why the average
reader always says of the histories of Francis Parkman
that they read like novels, even though the most German-minded
scientists of history assure us that Parkman
is always faithful to his facts. Facts, to the mind of
this model of historians, were indicative of truths; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
those truths he endeavored to express with faultless art.
Like the best of novelists, he was at once a scientist, a
philosopher, and an artist; and this is not the least of
reasons why his histories will endure. They are as true
as fiction.</p>
<p><b>Fiction Which Is True.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Not only do the great characters
of fiction convince us of reality: in the mere events
themselves of worthy fiction we feel a fitness that
makes us know them real. Sentimental Tommy really
did lose that literary competition because he wasted
a full hour searching vainly for the one right word;
Hetty Sorrel really killed her child; and Mr. Henry
must have won that midnight duel with the Master of
Ballantrae, though the latter was the better swordsman.
These incidents conform to truths we recognize. And
not only in the fiction that clings close to actuality do
we feel a sense of truth. We feel it just as keenly in
fairy tales like those of Hans Christian Andersen, or in
the worthiest wonder-legends of an earlier age. We
are told of The Steadfast Tin Soldier that, after he was
melted in the fire, the maid who took away the ashes next
morning found him in the shape of a small tin heart;
and remembering the spangly little ballet-dancer who
fluttered to him like a sylph and was burned up in the
fire with him, we feel a fitness in this little fancy which
opens vistas upon human truth. Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s fable of
&ldquo;How the Elephant Got His Trunk&rdquo; is just as true as
his reports of Mrs. Hauksbee. His theory may not conform
with the actual facts of zoological science; but at
any rate it represents a truth which is perhaps more
important for those who have become again like little
children.</p>
<p><b>Fiction Which Is False.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Just as we feel by instinct
the reality of fiction at its best, so also with a kindred
instinct equally keen we feel the falsity of fiction when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the author lapses from the truth. Unless his characters
act and think at all points consistently with the laws of
their imagined existence, and unless these laws are in
harmony with the laws of actual life, no amount of
sophistication on the part of the author can make us
finally believe his story; and unless we believe his story,
his purpose in writing it will have failed. The novelist,
who has so many means of telling truth, has also many
means of telling lies. He may be untruthful in his very
theme, if he is lacking in sanity of outlook upon the
things that are. He may be untruthful in his characterization,
if he interferes with his people after they are
once created and attempts to coerce them to his purposes
instead of allowing them to work out their own destinies.
He may be untruthful in his plotting, if he devises
situations arbitrarily for the sake of mere immediate
effect. He may be untruthful in his dialogue, if he puts
into the mouths of his people sentences that their
nature does not demand that they shall speak. He may
be untruthful in his comments on his characters, if the
characters belie the comments in their actions and their
words.</p>
<p><b>Casual Sins Against the Truth in Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;With
the sort of fiction that is a tissue of lies, the present
study does not concern itself; but even in the best fiction
we come upon passages of falsity. There is little likelihood,
however, of our being led astray by these: we
revolt instinctively against them with a feeling that may
best be expressed in that famous sentence of Ibsen&rsquo;s
Assessor Brack, &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t do such things.&rdquo; When
Shakespeare tells us, toward the end of &ldquo;As You Like
It,&rdquo; that the wicked Oliver suddenly changed his nature
and won the love of Celia, we know that he is lying. The
scene is not true to the great laws of human life. When
George Eliot, at a loss for a conclusion to &ldquo;The Mill on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
the Floss,&rdquo; tells us that Tom and Maggie Tulliver were
drowned together in a flood, we disbelieve her; just as we
disbelieve Sir James Barrie when he invents that absurd
accident of Tommy&rsquo;s death. These three instances of
falsity have been selected from authors who know the
truth and almost always tell it; and all three have a certain
palliation. They come at or near the very end of
lengthy stories. In actual life, of course, there are no
very ends: life exhibits a continuous sequence of causation
stretching on: and since a story has to have an end,
its conclusion must in any case belie a law of nature.
Probably the truth is that Tommy didn&rsquo;t die at all: he
is living still, and always will be living. And since Sir
James Barrie couldn&rsquo;t write forever, he may be pardoned
a makeshift ending that he himself apparently did not
believe in. So also we may forgive that lie of Shakespeare&rsquo;s,
since it contributes to a general truthfulness of
good-will at the conclusion of his story; and as for
George Eliot&ndash;&ndash;well, she had been telling the truth
stolidly for many hundred pages.</p>
<p><b>More Serious Sins Against the Truth.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But when
Charlotte Bront&euml;, in &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; tells us that Mr.
Rochester first said and then repeated the following
sentence, &ldquo;I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
to-night,&rdquo; we find it more difficult to pardon
the apparent falsity. In the same chapter, the author
states that Mr. Rochester emitted the following remark:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Then,
in the first place, do you agree with me that
I have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps
exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely,
that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
battled through a varied experience with many men of
many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while
you have lived quietly with one set of people in one
house?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>Such writing is inexcusably untrue. We cannot believe
that any human being ever asked a direct question
so elaborately lengthy. People do not talk like that.
As a contrast, let us notice for a moment the poignant
truthfulness of speech in Mr. Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s story,
&ldquo;Only a Subaltern.&rdquo; A fever-stricken private says to
Bobby Wick, &ldquo;Beg y&rsquo; pardon, sir, disturbin&rsquo; of you now,
but would you min&rsquo; &rsquo;oldin&rsquo; my &rsquo;and, sir&rdquo;?&ndash;&ndash;and later,
when the private becomes convalescent and Bobby in
his turn is stricken down, the private suddenly stares in
horror at his bed, and cries, &ldquo;Oh, my Gawd! It can&rsquo;t
be <i>&rsquo;im!</i>&rdquo; People talk like that.</p>
<p><b>The Futility of the Adventitious.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Arbitrary plotting,
as a rule, is of no avail in fiction: almost always,
we know when a story is true and when it is not. We
seldom believe in the long-lost will that is discovered at
last on the back of a decaying picture-canvas; or in the
chance meeting and mutual discovery of long-separated
relatives; or in such accidental circumstances as the
one, for instance, because of which Romeo fails to receive
the message from Friar Laurence. The incidents
of fiction at its best are not only probable but inevitable:
they happen because in the nature of things they have
to happen, and not because the author wants them to.
Similarly, the truest characters of fiction are so real
that even their creator has no power to make them do
what they will not. It has been told of Thackeray that
he grew so to love Colonel Newcome that he wished
ardently that the good man might live happily until the
end. Yet, knowing the circumstances in which the
Colonel was enmeshed, and knowing also the nature of
the people who formed the little circle round about him,
Thackeray realized that his last days would of necessity
be miserable; and realizing this, the author told the
bitter truth, though it cost him many tears.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p><b>The Independence of Created Characters.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The careless
reader of fiction usually supposes that, since the
novelist invents his characters and incidents, he can
order them always to suit his own desires: but any
honest artist will tell you that his characters often grow
intractable and stubbornly refuse at certain points to
accept the incidents which he has foreordained for them,
and that at other times they take matters into their
own hands and run away with the story. Stevenson has
recorded this latter experience. He said, apropos of
&ldquo;Kidnapped,&rdquo; &ldquo;In one of my books, and in one only,
the characters took the bit in their teeth; all at once,
they became detached from the flat paper, they turned
their backs on me and walked off bodily; and from
that time my task was stenographic&ndash;&ndash;it was they who
spoke, it was they who wrote the remainder of the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laws of life, and not the author&rsquo;s will, must finally
decide the destinies of heroes and of heroines. On the
evening of February 3, 1850, just after he had written
the last scene of &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter,&rdquo; Hawthorne read
it to his wife&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;tried to read it, rather,&rdquo; he wrote the
next day in a letter to his friend, Horatio Bridge, &ldquo;for my
voice swelled and heaved, as if I were tossed up and
down on an ocean as it subsides after a storm. But I was
in a very nervous state then, having gone through a great
diversity of emotion while writing it for many months.&rdquo;
Is it not conceivable that, in the &ldquo;great diversity of emotion&rdquo;
which the author experienced while bringing his
story to a close, he was tempted more than once to state
that Hester and Dimmesdale escaped upon the Bristol
ship and thereafter expiated their offense in holy and
serviceable lives? But if such a thought occurred to him,
he put it by, knowing that the revelation of the scarlet
letter was inexorably demanded by the highest moral
law.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p><b>Fiction More True Than a Casual Report of Fact.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We
are now ready to understand the statement that fiction at
its best is much more true than such careless reports of
actual occurrences as are published in the daily newspapers.
Water that has been distilled is much more
really H<sub>2</sub>O than the muddied natural liquid in the bulb
of the retort; and life that has been clarified in the
threefold alembic of the fiction-writer&rsquo;s mind is much
more really life than the clouded and unrealized events
that are reported in daily chronicles of fact. The newspaper
may tell us that a man who left his office in an
apparently normal state of mind went home and shot his
wife; but people don&rsquo;t do such things; and though the
story states an actual occurrence, it does not tell the
truth. The only way in which the reporter could make
this story true would be for him to trace out all the antecedent
causes which led inevitably to the culminating
incident. The incident itself can become true for us
only when we are made to understand it.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson once remarked that whenever,
in a story by a friend of his, he came upon a passage
that was notably untrue, he always suspected that it
had been transcribed directly from actual life. The
author had been too sure of the facts to ask himself in
what way they were representative of the general laws
of life. But facts are important to the careful thinker
only as they are significant of truth. Doubtless an
omniscient mind would realize a reason for every accidental
and apparently insignificant occurrence of
actual life. Doubtless, for example, the Universal
Mind must understand why the great musical-director,
Anton Seidl, died suddenly of ptomaine poisoning. But
to a finite mind such occurrences seem unsignificant of
truth; they do not seem to be indicative of a necessary
law. And since the fiction-writer has a finite mind, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
laws of life which he can understand are more restrictedly
logical than those undiscovered laws of actual life
which pass his understanding. Many a casual occurrence
of the actual world would therefore be inadmissible
in the intellectually-ordered world of fiction. A novelist
has no right to set forth a sequence of events which, in
its causes and effects, he cannot make the reader understand.</p>
<p><b>The Exception and the Law.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We are now touching
on a principle which is seldom appreciated by beginners
in the art of fiction. Every college professor of literary
composition who has accused a student of falsity in some
passage of a story that the student has submitted has
been met with the triumphant but unreasonable answer,
&ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s true! It happened to a friend of mine!&rdquo;
And it has then become necessary for the professor to
explain as best he could that an actual occurrence is not
necessarily true for the purposes of fiction. The imagined
facts of a genuinely worthy story are exhibited
merely because they are representative of some general
law of life held securely in the writer&rsquo;s consciousness. A
transcription, therefore, of actual facts fails of the
purposes of fiction unless the facts in themselves are
evidently representative of such a law. And many
things may happen to a friend of ours without evidencing
to a considerate mind any logical reason why they had
to happen.</p>
<p><b>Truthfulness the only Title to Immortality.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is
necessary that the student should appreciate the importance
of this principle at the very outset of his apprenticeship
to the art. For it is only by adhering
rigorously to the truth that fiction can survive. In every
period of literature, many clever authors have appeared
who have diverted their contemporaries with ingenious
invention, brilliant incident, unexpected novelty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
character, or alluring eloquence of style, but who have
been discarded and forgotten by succeeding generations
merely because they failed to tell the truth. Probably in
the whole range of English fiction there is no more skilful
weaver of enthralling plots, no more clever master of invention
or manipulator of suspense, than Wilkie Collins;
but Collins is already discarded and well-nigh forgotten,
because the reading world has found that he exhibited no
truths of genuine importance, but rather sacrificed the
eternal realities of life for mere momentary plausibilities.
Probably, also, there is no artist in French prose more
seductive in his eloquence than Ren&eacute; de Chateaubriand;
but his fiction is no longer read, because the world has
found that his sentimentalism was to this extent a sham&ndash;&ndash;it
was false to the nature of normal human beings.
&ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; will survive the works of both
these able authors, because of the many and momentous
human truths that look upon us through its drift of
dreams.</p>
<p><b>Morality and Immorality in Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The whole
question of the morality or immorality of a work of
fiction is a question merely of its truth or falsity. To
appreciate this point, we must first be careful to distinguish
immorality from coarseness. The morality of a
fiction-writer is not dependent on the decency of his
expression. In fact, the history of literature shows that
authors frankly coarse, like Rabelais or Swift for instance,
have rarely or never been immoral; and that the most
immoral books have been written in the most delicate
language. Swift and Rabelais are moral, because they
tell the truth with sanity and vigor; we may object to
certain passages in their writings on esthetic, but not on
ethical, grounds. They may offend our taste; but they
are not likely to lead astray our judgment&ndash;&ndash;far less
likely than D&rsquo;Annunzio, for instance, who, although he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
never offends the most delicate esthetic taste, sicklies o&rsquo;er
with the pale cast of his poetry a sad unsanity of outlook
upon the ultimate deep truths of human life. In the
second place, we must bravely realize that the morality
of a work of fiction has little or no dependence on the
subject that it treats. It is utterly unjust to the novelist
to decide, as many unreasonable readers do, that such a
book as Daudet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sapho&rdquo; must be of necessity immoral
because it exhibits immoral characters in a series of
immoral acts. There is no such thing as an immoral
subject for a novel: in the treatment of the subject, and
only in the treatment, lies the basis for ethical judgment
of the work. The one thing needful in order that a novel
may be moral is that the author shall maintain throughout
his work a sane and healthy insight into the soundness
or unsoundness of the relations between his characters.
He must know when they are right and know when they
are wrong, and must make clear to us the reasons for his
judgment. He cannot be immoral unless he is untrue.
To make us pity his characters when they are vile, or love
them when they are noxious, to invent excuses for them
in situations where they cannot be excused, to leave us
satisfied when their baseness has been unbetrayed, to
make us wonder if after all the exception is not greater
than the rule&ndash;&ndash;in a single word, to lie about his characters&ndash;&ndash;this
is, for the fiction-writer, the one unpardonable
sin.</p>
<p><b>The Faculty of Wisdom.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But it is not an easy thing
to tell the truth of human life, and nothing but the truth.
The best of fiction-writers fall to falsehood now and
then; and it is only by honest labor and sincere strife
for the ideal that they contrive in the main to fulfil the
purpose of their art. But the writer of fiction must be
not only honest and sincere; he must be wise as well.
<i>Wisdom is the faculty of seeing through and all around an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
object of contemplation, and understanding totally and at
once its relations to all other objects.</i> This faculty cannot
be acquired; it has to be developed: and it is developed
by experience only. Experience ordinarily requires time;
and though, for special reasons which will be noted later
on, most of the great short-story writers have been
young, we are not surprised to notice that most of the
great novelists have been men mature in years. They
have ripened slowly to a realization of those truths
which later they have labored to impart. Richardson,
the father of the modern English novel, was fifty-one
years old when &ldquo;Pamela&rdquo; was published; Scott was
forty-three when &ldquo;Waverley&rdquo; appeared; Hawthorne was
forty-six when he wrote &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter&rdquo;; Thackeray
and George Eliot were well on their way to the forties
when they completed &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;Adam Bede&rdquo;;
and these are the first novels of each writer.</p>
<p><b>Wisdom and Technic.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The young author who aspires
to write novels must not only labor to acquire
the technic of his art: it is even more important that
he should so order his life as to grow cunning in the
basic truths of human nature. His first problem&ndash;&ndash;the
problem of acquiring technic&ndash;&ndash;is comparatively easy.
Technic may be learned from books&ndash;&ndash;the master-works
of art in fiction. It may be studied empirically. The
student may observe what the masters have, and have
not, done; and he may puzzle out the reasons why. And
he may perhaps be helped by constructive critics of
fiction in his endeavor to understand these reasons.
But his second problem&ndash;&ndash;the problem of developing
wisdom&ndash;&ndash;is more difficult; and he must grapple with it
without any aid from books. What he learns of human
life, he must learn in his own way, without extraneous
assistance.</p>
<p>It is easy enough for the student to learn, for instance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
how the great short-stories have been constructed. It is
easy enough for the critic, on the basis of such knowledge,
to formulate empirically the principles of this special art
of narrative. But it is not easy for the student to discover,
or for the critic to suggest, how a man in his early
twenties may develop such a wise insight into human life
as is displayed, for example, in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Without
Benefit of Clergy.&rdquo; A few suggestions may, perhaps, be
offered; but they must be considered merely as suggestions,
and must not be overvalued.</p>
<p><b>General and Particular Experience.</b>&ndash;&ndash;At the outset,
it may be noted that the writer of fiction needs two
different endowments of experience:&ndash;&ndash;first, a broad and
general experience of life at large; and second, a deep
and specific experience of that particular phase of life
which he wishes to depict. A general and broad experience
is common to all masters of the art of fiction:
it is in the particular nature of their specific and deep
experience that they differ one from another. Although
in range and sweep of general knowledge Sir Walter
Scott was far more vast than Jane Austen, he confessed
amazement at the depth of her specific knowledge of
every-day English middle-class society. Most of the great
novelists have made, like Jane Austen, a special study
of some particular field. Hawthorne is an authority on
Puritan New England, Thackeray on London high
society, Henry James on cosmopolitan super-civilization.
It would seem, therefore, that a young author, while
keeping his observation fresh for all experience, should
devote especial notice to experience of some particular
phase of life. But along comes Mr. Rudyard Kipling,
with his world-engirdling knowledge, to jostle us out of
faith in too narrow a focus of attention.</p>
<p><b>Extensive and Intensive Experience.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Experience is
of two sorts, extensive and intensive. A mere glance at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the range of Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s subjects would show us the
breadth of his extensive experience: evidently he has
lived in many lands and looked with sympathy upon
the lives of many sorts of people. But in certain stories,
like his &ldquo;They&rdquo; for instance, we are arrested rather by
the depth of his intensive experience. &ldquo;They&rdquo; reveals
to us an author who not necessarily has roamed about
the world, but who necessarily has felt all phases of the
mother-longing in a woman. The things that Mr.
Kipling knows in &ldquo;They&rdquo; could never have been learned
except through sympathy.</p>
<p>Intensive experience is immeasurably more valuable
to the fiction-writer than extensive experience: but the
difficulty is that, although the latter may be gained
through the obvious expedients of travel and voluntary
association with many and various types of people, the
former can never be gained through any amount of
deliberate and conscious seeking. The great intensive
experiences of life, like love and friendship, must come
unsought if they are to come at all; and no man can gain
a genuine experience of any joy or sorrow by experimenting
purposely with life. The deep experiences must be
watched and waited for. The author must be ever
ready to realize them when they come: when they knock
upon his door, he must not make the mistake of answering
that he is not at home. But he must not make the
contrary mistake of going out into the highways and
hedges to compel them to come within his gates.</p>
<p><b>The Experiencing Nature.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Undoubtedly, very few
people are always at home for every real experience that
knocks upon their doors; very few people, to say the
thing more simply, have an experiencing nature. But
great fiction may be written only by men of an experiencing
nature; and here is a basis for confession
that, after all, fiction-writers are born, not made. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
experiencing nature is difficult to define; but two of its
most evident qualities, at any rate, are a lively curiosity
and a ready sympathy. A combination of these two
qualities gives a man that intensity of interest in human
life which is a condition precedent to his ever growing
to understand it. Curiosity, for instance, is the most
obvious asset in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s equipment. We did
not need his playful confession in the &ldquo;Just So Stories&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;I keep six honest serving-men<br />
(They taught me all I knew):&ndash;&ndash;<br />
Their names are What and Why and When<br />
And How and Where and Who&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>to convince us that from his very early youth he has been
an indefatigable asker of questions. It was only through
a healthy curiosity that he could have acquired the
enormous stores of specific knowledge concerning almost
every walk of life that he has displayed in his successive
volumes. On the other hand, it was obviously through
his vast endowment of sympathy that Dickens was able
to learn so thoroughly all phases of the life of the lowly
in London.</p>
<p><b>Curiosity and Sympathy.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Experience gravitates to
the man who is both curious and sympathetic. The
kingdom of adventure is within us. Just as we create
beauty in an object when we look upon it beautifully,
so we create adventure all around us when we walk the
world inwardly aglow with love of life. Things of
interest happened to Robert Louis Stevenson every
day of his existence, because he incorporated the faculty
of being interested in things. In one of his most glowing
essays, &ldquo;The Lantern-Bearers,&rdquo; he declared that never
an hour of his life had gone dully yet; if it had been
spent waiting at a railway junction, he had had some
scattering thoughts, he had counted some grains of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
memory, compared to which the whole of many romances
seemed but dross. The author who aspires to write
fiction should cultivate the faculty of caring for all things
that come to pass; he should train himself rigorously
never to be bored; he should look upon all life that swims
into his ken with curious and sympathetic eyes, remembering
always that sympathy is a deeper faculty
than curiosity: and because of the profound joy of his
interest in life, he should endeavor humbly to earn that
heritage of interest by developing a thorough understanding
of its source. In this way, perhaps, he may grow
aware of certain truths of life which are materials for
fiction. If so, he will have accomplished the better half
of his work: he will have found something to say.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Two Methods of Exhibiting the Truth.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Although all
writers of fiction who take their work seriously and do
it honestly are at one in their purpose&ndash;&ndash;namely, to
embody certain truths of human life in a series of imagined
facts&ndash;&ndash;they diverge into two contrasted groups
according to their manner of accomplishing this purpose,&ndash;&ndash;their
method of exhibiting the truth. Consequently
we find in practice two contrasted schools of novelists,
which we distinguish by the titles Realistic and Romantic.</p>
<p><b>Every Mind Either Realistic or Romantic.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The distinction
between realism and romance is fundamental
and deep-seated; for every man, whether consciously
or not, is either a romantic or a realist in the dominant
habit of his thought. The reader who is a realist by
nature will prefer George Eliot to Scott; the reader who
is romantic will rather read Victor Hugo than Flaubert;
and neither taste is better than the other. Each reader&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
preference is born with his brain, and has its origin in
his customary processes of thinking. In view of this
fact, it seems strange that no adequate definition has
ever yet been made of the difference between realism
and romance.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> Various superficial explanations have
been offered, it is true; but none of them has been
scientific and satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>Marion Crawford&rsquo;s Faulty Distinction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;One of the
most common of these superficial explanations is the
one which has been phrased by the late F. Marion
Crawford in his little book upon &ldquo;The Novel: What It
Is&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The realist proposes to show men what they are;
the romantist (<i>sic</i>) tries to show men what they should
be.&rdquo; The trouble with this distinction is that it utterly
fails to distinguish. Surely all novelists, whether realistic
or romantic, try to show men what they are&ndash;&ndash;what
else can be their reason for embodying in imagined facts
the truths of human life? Victor Hugo, the romantic, in
&ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables,&rdquo; endeavors just as honestly and
earnestly to show men what they are as does Flaubert,
the realist, in &ldquo;Madame Bovary.&rdquo; And on the other
hand, Thackeray, the realist, in characters like Henry
Esmond and Colonel Newcome, shows men what they
should be just as thoroughly as the romantic Scott. Indeed,
it is hardly possible to conceive how any novelist,
whether romantic or realistic, could devise a means of
showing the one thing without at the same time showing
the other also. Every important fiction-writer, no
matter to which of the two schools he happens to belong,
strives to accomplish, in a single effort of creation, <i>both</i>
of the purposes noted by Marion Crawford. He may
be realistic or romantic in his way of showing men what
they are; realistic or romantic in his way of showing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
them what they should be: the difference lies, not in
which of the two he tries to show, but in the way he
tries to show it.</p>
<p><b>A Second Unsatisfactory Distinction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Again, we have
been told that, in their stories, the romantics dwell
mainly upon the element of action, while the realists
are interested chiefly in the element of character. But
this explanation fails many times to fit the facts: for
the great romantic characters, like Leather-Stocking,
Don Quixote, Monte Cristo, Claude Frollo, are just as
vividly drawn as the great characters of realism; and
the great events of realistic novels, like Rawdon Crawley&rsquo;s
discovery of his wife with Lord Steyne, or Adam
Bede&rsquo;s fight with Arthur Donnithorne, are just as thrilling
as the resounding actions of romance. Furthermore,
if we should accept this explanation, we should find ourselves
unable to classify as either realistic or romantic
the very large body of novels in which neither element&ndash;&ndash;of
action or of character&ndash;&ndash;shows any marked preponderance
over the other. Henry James, in his genial essay
on &ldquo;The Art of Fiction,&rdquo; has cast a vivid light on this
objection. &ldquo;There is an old-fashioned distinction,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;between the novel of character and the novel
of incident which must have cost many a smile to the
intending fabulist who was keen about his work....
What is character but the determination of incident?
What is incident but the illustration of character?...
It is an incident for a woman to stand up with
her hand resting on a table and look out at you in a
certain way; or if it be not an incident I think it will be
hard to say what it is. At the same time it is an expression
of character.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>A Third Unsatisfactory Distinction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We have been
told also that the realists paint the manners of their own
place and time, while the romantics deal with more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
remote materials. But this distinction, likewise, often
fails to hold. No stories were ever more essentially
romantic than Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Arabian Nights,&rdquo;
which depict details of London and Parisian life at the
time when the author wrote them; and no novel is
more essentially realistic than &ldquo;Romola,&rdquo; which carries
us back through many centuries to a medieval city far
away. Thackeray, the realist, in &ldquo;Henry Esmond,&rdquo; and
its sequel &ldquo;The Virginians,&rdquo; departed further from his
own time and place than Hawthorne, the romantic, in
&ldquo;The House of the Seven Gables&rdquo;; and while the realistic
Meredith frequently fares abroad in his stories,
especially to Italy, the romantic Barrie looks upon life
almost always from his own little window in Thrums.</p>
<p><b>Bliss Perry&rsquo;s Negative Definition.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In his interesting
and suggestive &ldquo;Study of Prose Fiction,&rdquo; Professor Bliss
Perry has devoted a chapter to realism and another to
romance; but he has not succeeded in defining either
term. He has, to be sure, essayed a negative definition
of realism:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Realistic fiction is that which does not
shrink from the commonplace or from the unpleasant
in its effort to depict things as they are, life as it is.&rdquo;
But we have seen that the effort of all fiction, whether
realistic or romantic, is to depict life as it <i>really</i> (though
not necessarily as it <i>actually</i>) is. Does not &ldquo;The Brushwood
Boy,&rdquo; although it suggests the super-actual, set
forth a common truth of the most intimate human
relationship, which every lover recognizes as real? Every
great writer of fiction tries, in his own romantic or
realistic way, to &ldquo;draw the Thing as he sees It for the
God of Things as They Are.&rdquo; We must therefore focus
our attention mainly on the earlier phrases of Professor
Perry&rsquo;s definition. He states that realistic fiction does
not shrink from the commonplace. That depends. The
realism of Jules and Edmond de Goncourt does not, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
be sure; but most assuredly the realism of George
Meredith does. You will find far less shrinking from
the commonplace in many passages of the romantic
Fenimore Cooper than in the pages of George Meredith.
Whether or not realistic fiction shrinks from the unpleasant
depends also on the particular nature of the
realist. Zola&rsquo;s realism certainly does not; Jane Austen&rsquo;s
decidedly does. You will find far less shrinking from
the unpleasant, of one sort, in Poe, of another sort, in
Catulle Mend&egrave;s&ndash;&ndash;both of them romantics&ndash;&ndash;than in the
novels of Jane Austen. What is the use, then, of Professor
Perry&rsquo;s definition of realism, since it remains
open to so many exceptions? And in his chapter on
romance the critic does not even attempt to formulate
a definition.</p>
<p><b>The True Distinction One of Method, Not of Material.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We
have now examined several of the current explanations
of the difference between romance and realism and
have found that each is wanting. The trouble with all
of them seems to be that they attempt to find a basis for
distinguishing between the two schools of fiction in the
subject-matter, or materials, of the novelist. Does not
the real distinction lie rather in the novelist&rsquo;s attitude
of mind toward his materials, whatever those materials
may be? Surely there is no such thing inherently as a
realistic subject or a romantic subject. The very same
subject may be treated realistically by one novelist and
romantically by another. George Eliot would have built
a realistic novel on the theme of &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter&rdquo;;
and Hawthorne would have made a romance out of the
materials of &ldquo;Silas Marner.&rdquo; The whole of human life,
or any part of it, offers materials for romantic and realist
alike. Therefore no distinction between the schools is
possible upon the basis of subject-matter: the real distinction
must be one of method in setting subject-matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
forth. The distinction is not external, but internal; it
dwells in the mind of the novelist; it is a matter for
philosophic, not for literary, investigation.</p>
<p><b>Scientific Discovery and Artistic Expression.</b>&ndash;&ndash;If we
seek within the mental habits of the novelist for a
philosophic distinction between realism and romance, we
shall have to return to a consideration of that threefold
process of the fiction-making mind which was expounded
in the preceding chapter of this book. Scientific discovery,
philosophic understanding, and artistic expression
of the truths of human life are phases of creation
common to romantics and realists alike; but though the
writers of both schools meet equally upon the central
ground of philosophic understanding, is it not evident that
the realists are most interested in looking backward over
the antecedent ground of scientific discovery, and the
romantics are most interested in looking forward over
the subsequent ground of artistic expression? Suppose,
for the purpose of illustration, that two novelists of equal
ability&ndash;&ndash;the one a realist, the other a romantic&ndash;&ndash;have
observed and studied carefully the same events and
characters of actual life; and suppose further that they
agree in their conception of the truth behind the facts.
Suppose now that each of them writes a novel to embody
this conception of the truth, in which they are agreed.
Will not the realist regard as most important the scientific
process of discovery by means of which he arrived at his
conception; and will he not therefore strive to make that
process clear to the reader by turning back to the point
at which he began his observations and then leading the
reader forward through a similar scientific study of imagined
facts until the reader joins him on the ground of
philosophic understanding? And, on the other hand,
will not the romantic regard as most important the
artistic process of embodying his conception; and will he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
not therefore be satisfied with any means of embodying
it clearly and effectively, without caring whether or not
the imagined facts which he selects for this purpose are
similar to the actual facts from which he first induced
his philosophic understanding?</p>
<p><b>The Testimony of Hawthorne.</b>&ndash;&ndash;This thought was
apparently in Hawthorne&rsquo;s mind when, in the preface to
&ldquo;The House of the Seven Gables,&rdquo; he wrote his well-known
distinction between the Romance and the
(realistic) Novel:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;When a writer calls his work a
Romance, it need hardly be observed that he wishes to
claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material,
which he would not have felt himself entitled to
assume had he professed to be writing a Novel. The
latter form of composition is presumed to aim at a very
minute fidelity, not merely to the possible, but to the
probable and ordinary course of man&rsquo;s experience. The
former&ndash;&ndash;while, as a work of art, it must rigidly subject
itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as
it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart&ndash;&ndash;has
fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances,
to a great extent, of the writer&rsquo;s own choosing
or creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>A Philosophic Formula.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But Hawthorne&rsquo;s statement,
although it covers the ground, is not succinct and
definitive; and if we are to examine the thesis thoroughly,
we had better first state it in philosophic terms and then
elucidate the statement by explanation and by illustration.
So stated, the distinction is as follows: <i>In
setting forth his view of life, the realist follows the inductive
method of presentment, and the romantic follows the
deductive method.</i></p>
<p><b>Induction and Deduction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The distinction between
inductive and deductive processes of thinking is very
simple and is known to all: it is based upon the <i>direction</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of the train of thought. When we think inductively,
we reason from the particular to the general; and when
we think deductively, the process proceeds in the reverse
direction and we reason from the general to the particular.
In our ordinary conversation, we speak inductively
when we first mention a number of specific facts and
then draw from them some general inference; and we
speak deductively when we first express a general
opinion and then elucidate it by adducing specific
illustrations. That old dichotomy of the psychologists
which divides all men, according to their habits of
thought, into Platonists and Aristotelians (or, to substitute
a modern nomenclature, into Cartesians and
Baconians) is merely an assertion that every man, in the
prevailing direction of his thinking, is either deductive
or inductive. Most of the great ethical philosophers
have had inductive minds; from the basis of admitted
facts of experience they have reasoned out their laws of
conduct. Most of the great religious teachers have had
deductive minds: from the basis of certain sublime
assumptions they have asserted their commandments.
Most of the great scientists have thought inductively:
they have reasoned from specific facts to general truths,
as Newton reasoned from the fall of an apple to the law
of gravitation. Most of the great poets have thought
deductively: they have reasoned from general truths to
specific facts, as Dante reasoned from a general moral
conception of cosmogony to the particular appropriate
details of every circle in hell and purgatory and paradise.
Now is not the thesis tenable that it is in just this way
that realism differs from romance? In their endeavor
to exhibit certain truths of human life, do not the realists
work inductively and the romantics deductively?</p>
<p><b>The Inductive Method of the Realist.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In order to
bring to our knowledge the law of life which he wishes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
to make clear, the realist first leads us through a series
of imagined facts as similar as possible to the details of
actual life which he studied in order to arrive at his
general conception. He elaborately imitates the facts
of actual life, so that he may say to us finally, &ldquo;This is
the sort of thing that I have seen in the world, and from
this I have learned the truth I have to tell you.&rdquo; He
leads us step by step from the particular to the general,
until we gradually grow aware of the truths he wishes
to express. And in the end, we have not only grown
acquainted with these truths, but have also been made
familiar with every step in the process of thought by
which the author himself became aware of them. &ldquo;Adam
Bede&rdquo; tells us not only what George Eliot knew of life,
but also how she came to learn it.</p>
<p><b>The Deductive Method of the Romantic.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But the
romantic novelist leads us in the contrary direction&ndash;&ndash;namely,
from the general to the particular. He does
not attempt to show us how he arrived at his general
conception. His only care is to convey his general idea
effectively by giving it a specific illustrative embodiment.
He feels no obligation to make the imagined facts
of his story resemble closely the details of actual life; he
is anxious only that they shall represent his idea adequately
and consistently. Stevenson knew that man
has a dual nature, and that the evil in him, when pampered,
will gradually gain the upper hand over the good.
In his story of the &ldquo;Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde,&rdquo; he did not attempt to set forth this truth inductively,
showing us the kind of facts from the observation
of which he had drawn this conclusion. He merely
gave his thought an illustrative embodiment, by conceiving
a dual character in which a man&rsquo;s uglier self
should have a separate incarnation. He constructed his
tale deductively: beginning with a general conception,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
he reduced it to particular terms. &ldquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde&rdquo; is, of course, a thoroughly true story, even though
its incidents are contrary to the actual facts of life. It is
just as real as a realistic novel; but in order to make it
so, its author, because he was working deductively, was
not obliged to imitate the details of actual life which he
had studied. &ldquo;I have learned something in the world,&rdquo; he
says to us: &ldquo;Here is a fable that will make it clear to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Realism, Like Inductive Science, a Strictly Modern
Product.</b>&ndash;&ndash;This philosophic distinction between the
methods of romance and realism shows two manifest
advantages over all the other attempts at a distinction
which have been examined in this chapter: first, it
really does distinguish; and secondly, it will be found in
every case to fit the facts. Furthermore, it is supported
in an overwhelming manner by the history of human
thought. Every student of philosophy will tell you that
the world&rsquo;s thought was prevailingly deductive till the
days of Francis Bacon. Bacon was the first philosopher
to insist that induction, rather than deduction, was the
most effective method of searching for the truth. Science,
which is based upon induction, was in its infancy when
Bacon taught; since then it has matured, largely because
he and his successors in philosophy pointed out the only
method through which it might develop. Deduction
has of course survived as a method of conducting
thought; but it has lost the undisputed empery which it
held over the ancient and the medieval mind. Now, if
we turn to the history of fiction, we shall notice the
significant fact that realism is a strictly modern product.
All fiction was romantic till the days of Bacon. Realism
is contemporaneous with modern science and the other
applications of inductive thought. Romance survives,
of course; but it has lost the undisputed empery of fiction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
which it held in ancient and in medieval times. If
Bacon had written fiction, he would have been a realist&ndash;&ndash;the
first realist in the history of literature; and this
is the only reply that is necessary to those who still
maintain (if any do) that he was capable of writing the
romantic plays of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>If it be granted now that the realist, by induction,
leads his reader up from a consideration of imagined facts
to a comprehension of truth, and that the romantic, by
deduction, leads his reader down from an apprehension
of truth to a consideration of imagined facts, we may
next examine certain advantages and disadvantages of
each method in comparison with the other.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of Realism.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In the first place, we notice,
that, while the imagined facts of the romantic are selected
merely to illustrate the truth he wishes to convey, the
imagined facts of the realist are selected not only to
illustrate, but also to support, the truth that lies inherent
in them. The realist, then, has this advantage,
over the romantic in his method of expressing truth:
he has the opportunity to prove his case by presenting
the evidence on which his truth is based. It is therefore
less difficult for him to conquer credence from a skeptical
and wary reader: and we must remember always
that even though a story tells the truth, it is still a
failure unless it gets that truth believed. The romantic
necessarily demands a deeper faith in his wisdom than
the realist need ask for; and he can evoke deep faith only
by absolute sincerity and utter clearness in the presentation
of his fable. Unless the reader of &ldquo;The Brushwood
Boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;They&rdquo; has absolute faith that Mr. Kipling
knows the truth of his themes, the stories are reduced to
nonsense; for they present no evidence (through running
parallel to actuality) which proves that the author <i>does</i>
know the truth. Unless the reader has faith that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Stevenson deeply understands the nature of remorse, the
conversation between Markheim and his ghostly visitant
becomes incredible and vain. The author gives himself
no opportunity to prove (through analogy with actual
experience) that such a colloquy consistently presents
the inner truth of conscience.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of Romance.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But this great advantage
of the realist&ndash;&ndash;that he supports his theme with evidence&ndash;&ndash;carries
with it an attendant disadvantage. Since he
lays his evidence bare before the reader, he makes it
simpler for the reader to detect him in a lie. The romantic
says, &ldquo;These things are so, because I know they
are&rdquo;; and unless we reject him at once and in entirety
as a colossal liar, we are almost doomed to take his
word in the big moments of his story. But the realist
says, &ldquo;These things are so, because they are supported
by actual facts similar to the imagined facts in which
I clothe them&rdquo;; and we may answer at any point in the
story, &ldquo;Not at all! On the very basis of the facts you
show us, we know better than to take your word.&rdquo; In
other words, when the reader disbelieves a romance, he
does so by instinct, without necessarily knowing why;
but when he disbelieves a realistic novel, he does so by
logic, with the evidence before him.</p>
<p>A great romantic, therefore, must have the wisdom
that convinces by its very presence and conquers credence
through the reader&rsquo;s intuition. Who could disbelieve
the author of &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter&rdquo;? We do not need to
see his evidence in order to know that he knows. A great
realist, on the other hand, while he need not have the
triumphant and engaging mental personality necessary
to a great romantic, must have a thorough and complete
equipment of evidence discerned from observation of the
actual. He must have eyes and ears, though he need
not have a soul.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p><b>The Confinement of Realism.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A novelist of realistic
vent is, therefore, almost doomed to confine his fiction to
his own place and time. In no other period or nation
can he be so certain of his evidence. We know the
enormous labor with which George Eliot amassed
the materials for &ldquo;Romola,&rdquo; a realistic study of Florence
during the Renaissance; but though we recognize the
work as that of a thorough student, the details still
fail to convince us as do the details of her studies of
contemporary Warwickshire. The young aspirant to the
art of fiction who knows himself to be an incipient realist
had therefore best confine his efforts to attempted reproduction
of the life he sees about him. He had better
accept the common-sensible advice which the late Sir
Walter Besant gave in his lecture on &ldquo;The Art of
Fiction&rdquo;: &ldquo;A young lady brought up in a quiet country
village should avoid descriptions of garrison life; a writer
whose friends and personal experiences belong to what
we call the lower middle class should carefully avoid
introducing his characters into society; a South-countryman
would hesitate before attempting to reproduce the
North-country accent. This is a very simple rule, but
one to which there should be no exception&ndash;&ndash;never to go
beyond your own experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Freedom of Romance.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The incipient realist is
almost obliged to accept this advice; but the incipient
romantic need not necessarily do so. That final injunction
of Besant&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;never to go beyond your own
experience&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;seems somewhat stultifying to the imagination;
and there is a great deal of very wise suggestion
in Henry James&rsquo; reply to it: &ldquo;What kind of
experience is intended, and where does it begin and
end?... The young lady living in a village has
only to be a damsel upon whom nothing is lost to make it
quite unfair (as it seems to me) to declare to her that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
shall have nothing to say about the military. Greater
miracles have been seen than that, imagination assisting,
she should speak the truth about some of these gentlemen.&rdquo;
The romantic &ldquo;upon whom nothing is lost,&rdquo; may,
&ldquo;imagination assisting,&rdquo; project his truth into some other
region of experience than those which he has actually
observed. Edgar Allan Poe is indubitably one of the
great masters of the art of fiction; but there is nothing in
any of his stories to indicate that he was born in Boston,
lived in Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York, and
died in Baltimore. &ldquo;The Assignation&rdquo; indicates that he
had lived in Venice&ndash;&ndash;where, in fact, he had never been;
others of his stories have the atmosphere of other times
and lands; and most of them pass in a dream-world of
his own creation, &ldquo;out of space, out of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So long as the romantic is sure of his truth and certain
of his power to convince the reader, he need not support
his truth by an accumulation of evidence imitated from
the actual life he has observed. But on the other hand,
there is nothing to prevent his doing so; and unless he be
very headstrong&ndash;&ndash;so headstrong as to be almost unreliable&ndash;&ndash;he
will be extremely chary of his freedom.
He will not subvert the actual unless there is no other
equally effective means of conveying the truth he has to
tell. Many times a close adherence to actuality is as
advisable for the deductive author as it is for the inductive;
many times the romantic writer gains as much as
the realist by confining his fiction to his own environment
of time and place. Scott, after all, was less successful
with his medieval kings and knights than with his
homely and simple Scottish characters. Hawthorne, in
&ldquo;The Marble Faun,&rdquo; lost a certain completeness of effect
by stepping off his own New England shadow. &ldquo;Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,&rdquo; with its subversion of the actual,
is the sort of story that might be set out of space, out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
of time; but Stevenson enhanced the effect of its imaginative
plausibility by setting it in contemporary London.
More and more, in recent years, the romantics
have followed the lead of the realists in embodying their
truth in scenes and characters imitated from actuality.
The early stories of the thoroughly romantic Mr. Kipling
were set in his own country, India, and in his own time;
and it was not until his actual experience had broadened
to other lands, that, to any great extent, his subjects
broadened geographically. In his stories of his own
people, Mr. Kipling just as faithfully portrays the every-day
existence he has actually observed as any realist.
His method is romantic always: he deduces his details
from his theme, instead of inducing his theme from his
details. He is entirely romantic in the direction of his
thought; but it is very suggestive of the tenor of contemporary
romance, to notice that he has taken the
advice of the realists and seldom gone beyond his own
experience.</p>
<p>The range of romance is therefore far wider than the
range of realism; for all that may be treated realistically
may be treated romantically also, and much else that
may be treated romantically is hardly susceptible of realistic
treatment. Granted that a romantic have truths
enough in his head, there is scarcely any limit to the
stories he may deduce from them; while, on the other
hand, the work of the inductive novelist is limited by the
limits of his premises. But the greater freedom of
romance is attended by a more difficult responsibility.
If it be easier for the romantic to tell the truth, because
he has more ways of telling it, it is surely harder for him
to tell nothing but the truth. More often than the
realist he is tempted to assert uncertainties&ndash;&ndash;tempted to
say with vividness and charm things of which he cannot
quite be sure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p><b>Neither Method Better Than the Other.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But whatever
may be the comparative advantages and disadvantages
of each method of exhibiting the truth, it is
absolutely certain that either method of presentment
is natural and logical; and hence all criticism that aims
to exalt romance above realism, or realism above romance,
must be forever futile. Guy de Maupassant, in
his valuable preface to &ldquo;Pierre et Jean,&rdquo; has spoken very
wisely on this point. The ideal critic, he says, should
demand of the artist merely to &ldquo;create something beautiful,
in the form most convenient to him, according to his
temperament.&rdquo; And he states further:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The critic
should appraise the result only according to the nature
of the effort.... He should admit with an equal
interest the contrasted theories of art, and judge the
works resultant from them only from the standpoint of
their artistic worth, accepting <i>a priori</i> the general ideas
from which they owe their origin. To contest the right
of an author to make a romantic or a realistic work is to
wish to force him to modify his temperament, refuse to
recognize his originality, and not permit him to employ
the eye and the intellect which nature has given him.
Let us allow him the liberty to understand, to observe,
and to conceive in whatever way he wishes, provided
that he be an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely this is the only sane view of the situation.
Therefore, when Mr. W. D. Howells, in his dexterous
little book on &ldquo;Criticism and Fiction,&rdquo; pleads engagingly
for realism as the only valid method for the modern
novelist, and when Stevenson, in many an alluring
essay, blows blasts upon the trumpet of romance, and
challenges the realists to show excuse for their existence,
each is fighting an unnecessary battle, since each is at
the same time right and wrong. Each is right in asserting
the value of his own method, and wrong in denying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the value of the other&rsquo;s. The minds of men have always
moved in two directions, and always will; and as long as
men shall write, we shall have, and ought to have, both
inductive and deductive fiction.</p>
<p><b>Abuses of Realism.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Neither of the two methods is
truer than the other; and both are great when they are
well employed. Each, however, lends itself to certain
abuses which it will be well for us to notice briefly.
The realist, on the one hand, in his careful imitation
of actual life, may grow near-sighted and come to value
facts for their own sake, forgetting that his primary
purpose in setting them forth should be to lead us to
understand the truths which underlie them. More and
more, as the realist advances in technic and gains in
ability to represent the actual, he is tempted to make
photographs of life instead of pictures. A picture differs
from a photograph mainly in its artistic repression of the
unsignificant; it exhibits life more truly because it focusses
attention on essentials. But any novel that dwells sedulously
upon non-essentials and exalts the unsignificant
obscures the truth. This is the fallacy of the photographic
method; and from this fallacy arise the tedious
minuteness of George Eliot in her more pedestrian
moments, the interminable tea-cups of Anthony Trollope,
and the mire of the imitators of Zola. Realism latterly,
especially in France, has shown a tendency to degenerate
into so-called &ldquo;naturalism,&rdquo; a method of art which casts
the unnatural emphasis of photographic reproduction
upon phases of actual life which are base in themselves
and unsignificant of the eternal instinct which leads
men more naturally to look upward at the stars than
downward at the mud. The &ldquo;naturalistic&rdquo; writers are
deceived in thinking that they represent life as it really
is. If their thesis were true, the human race would have
dwindled to extinction long ago. Surely a photograph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
of a slattern in the gutter is no more natural than a
picture of Rosalind in the Forest of Arden; and no
accuracy of imitated actuality can make it more significant
of truth.</p>
<p><b>Abuses of Romance.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The romantic, on the other
hand, because he works with greater freedom than the
realist, may overleap himself and express in a loose
fashion general conceptions which are hasty and devoid
of truth. To this defect is owing the vast deal of
rubbish which has been foisted on us recently by feeble
imitators of Scott and Dumas p&egrave;re&ndash;&ndash;imitators who have
assumed the trappings and the suits of the accredited
masters of romance, but have not inherited their clarity
of vision into the inner truth of things that are. To
such degenerate romance, Professor Brander Matthews
has applied the term &ldquo;romanticism&rdquo;; and though his
use of the term itself may be considered a little too
special for general currency, no exception can be taken
to the distinction which he enforces in the following
paragraph: &ldquo;The Romantic calls up the idea of something
primary, spontaneous, and perhaps medieval, while
the Romanticist suggests something secondary, conscious,
and of recent fabrication. Romance, like many another
thing of beauty, is very rare; but Romanticism is common
enough nowadays. The truly Romantic is difficult to
achieve; but the artificial Romanticist is so easy as to be
scarce worth the attempting. The Romantic is ever
young, ever fresh, ever delightful; but the Romanticist
is stale and second-hand and unendurable. Romance is
never in danger of growing old, for it deals with the spirit
of man without regard to times and seasons; but Romanticism
gets out of date with every twist of the kaleidoscope
of literary fashion. The Romantic is eternally and
essentially true, but the Romanticist is inevitably false.
Romance is sterling, but Romanticism is shoddy.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>But the Scylla and the Charybdis of fiction-writing
may both be avoided. The realists gain nothing by
hooting at the abuses of romance; and the romantics
gain as little by yawning over realism at its worst. &ldquo;The
conditions&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;to use a phase of Emerson&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;are hard
but equal&rdquo;: and at their best, the realist, working inductively,
and the romantic, working deductively, are
equally able to present the truth of fiction.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Transition from Material to Method.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We have now
considered the subject-matter of fiction and also the
contrasted attitudes of mind of the two great schools of
fiction-writers toward setting forth that subject-matter.
We must next turn our attention to the technical methods
of presenting the materials of fiction, and notice in
detail the most important devices employed by all
fiction-writers in order to fulfil the purpose of their art.</p>
<p><b>The Four Methods of Discourse</b>&ndash;&ndash;<b>1. Argumentation.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Rhetoricians,
as everybody knows, arbitrarily but conveniently
distinguish four forms, or moods, or methods,
of discourse: namely, narration, description, exposition,
and argumentation. It may be stated without fear of
well-founded contradiction that the natural mood, or
method, of fiction is the first of these,&ndash;&ndash;narration.
Argumentation, for its own sake, has no place in a work
of fiction. There is, to be sure, a type of novel, which is
generally called in English &ldquo;the novel with a purpose,&rdquo;
the aim of which is to persuade the reader to accept some
special thesis that the author holds concerning politics,
religion, social ethics, or some other of the phases of life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
that are readily open to discussion. But such a novel
usually fails of its purpose if it attempts to accomplish it
by employing the technical devices of argument. It can
best fulfil its purpose by exhibiting indisputable truths
of life, without persuasive comment, <i>ex cathedra</i>, on the
part of the novelist. In vain he argues, denounces, or
defends, appeals to us or coaxes us, unless his story in
the first place convinces by its very truthfulness. If his
thesis be as incontestable as the author thinks it is, it
can prove itself by narrative alone.</p>
<p><b>2. Exposition.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Exposition, for its own sake, is also
out of place in fiction. The aim of exposition is to explain,&ndash;&ndash;an
aim necessarily abstract; but the purpose of fiction
is to represent life,&ndash;&ndash;a purpose necessarily concrete. To
discourse of life in abstract terms is to subvert the
natural mood of art; and the novelist may make his
meaning just as clear by representing life concretely,
without a running commentary of analysis and explanation.
Life truly represented will explain itself. There
are, to be sure, a number of great novelists, of whom
George Eliot may be taken as the type, who frequently
halt their story to write an essay about it. These essays
are often instructive in themselves, but they are not
fiction, because they do not embody their truths in
imagined facts of human life. George Eliot is at one
moment properly a novelist, and at the next moment
a discursive expositor. She would be still greater as
a novelist, and a novelist merely, if she could make her
meaning clear without digressing to another art.</p>
<p><b>3. Description.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Description also, in the most artistic
fiction, is used only as subsidiary and contributive to
narration. The aim of description&ndash;&ndash;which is to suggest
the look of things at a certain characteristic moment&ndash;&ndash;is
an aim necessarily static. But life&ndash;&ndash;which the novelist
purposes to represent&ndash;&ndash;is not static but dynamic. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
aim of description is pictorial: but life does not hold its
pictures; it melts and merges them one into another with
headlong hurrying progression. A novelist who devotes
two successive pages to the description of a landscape or
a person, necessarily makes his story stand still while he
is doing it, and thereby belies an obvious law of life.
Therefore, as writers of fiction have progressed in art,
they have more and more eliminated description for its
own sake.</p>
<p><b>4. Narration, the Natural Mood of Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Since,
then, the natural mood, or method, of fiction is narration,
it is necessary that we should devote especial study
to the nature of narrative. And in a study frankly
technical we may be aided at the outset by a definition,
which may subsequently be explained in all its bearings.</p>
<p><i>A narrative is a representation of a series of events.</i>
This is a very simple definition; and only two words of
it can possibly demand elucidation. These words are
<i>series</i> and <i>event</i>. The word <i>event</i> will be explained fully
in a later section of this chapter: meanwhile it may be
understood loosely as synonymous with <i>happening</i>. Let
us first examine the exact meaning of the word <i>series</i>.</p>
<p><b>Series and Succession.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The word <i>series</i> implies much
more than the word <i>succession</i>: it implies a relation
not merely chronological but also logical; and the
logical relation it implies is that of cause and effect.
In any section of actual life which we examine, the
events are likely to appear merely in succession and
not in series. One event follows another immediately
in time, but does not seem linked to it immediately by
the law of causation. What you do this morning does
not often necessitate as a logical consequence what you
do this afternoon; and what you do this evening is
not often a logical result of what you have done during
the day. Any transcript from actual life that is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
deliberately arranged and logically patterned is therefore
likely not to be a narrative. A passage from a diary,
for instance, which states events in the order of their
happening but makes no attempt to present them as
links in a chain of causation, is not, technically speaking,
narrative in method. To illustrate this point, let us open
at random the diary of Samuel Pepys. Here is his entry
for April 29, 1666:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Church, where Mr. Mills, a lazy sermon upon the
Devil&rsquo;s having no right to anything in this world. To
Mr. Evelyn&rsquo;s, where I walked in his garden till he come
from Church, with great pleasure reading Ridley&rsquo;s discourse,
all my way going and coming, upon the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Law. He being come home, he and I
walked together in the garden with mighty pleasure, he being
a very ingenious man; and, the more I know him, the
the more I love him. Weary to bed, after having my hair
of my head cut shorter, even close to my skull, for coolness,
it being mighty hot weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no logical continuity in the worthy diarist&rsquo;s
faithful chronicle of actuality. What occasioned the
weariness with which he went to bed? It could not have
been the company of Mr. Evelyn, whom he loved; it
could hardly have been the volume on the civil and
ecclesiastical law, though its title does suggest the
soporific. Was his strength, like Samson&rsquo;s, shorn away
with the hair of his head; or can it be that that lazy
sermon of Mr. Mills&rsquo; got in its deadening effects at bedtime?
We notice, at any rate, that the diarist&rsquo;s remarks
need considerable re-arrangement to make them really
narrative.</p>
<p><b>Life Is Chronological, Art Is Logical.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Yet it is just in
this way that commonly event succeeds event in the
daily life of every one. It is only in the great passionate
crises of existence that event treads upon event in uninterrupted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
sequence of causation. And here is the main
formal difference between life as it actually happens and
life as it is artistically represented in history, biography,
and fiction. <i>In every art there are two steps; first, the
selection of essentials, and secondly, the arrangement of
these essentials according to a pattern.</i> In the art of
narration, events are first selected because they suggest
an essential logical relation to each other; and they
are then arranged along the lines of a pattern of causation.
Let us compare with the haphazard passage from Pepys
a bit of narrative that is artistically patterned. Here
is the conclusion to Stevenson&rsquo;s story of &ldquo;Markheim.&rdquo;
The hero, having slain a dealer in his shop on Christmas
day, spends a long time alone, ransacking the dealer&rsquo;s
effects and listening to the voice of conscience. He is
interrupted by a ringing of the door-bell. The dealer&rsquo;s
maid has returned from holidaying.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He opened the door and went downstairs very slowly,
thinking to himself. His past went soberly before him;
he beheld it as it was, ugly and strenuous like a dream,
random as a chance-medley&ndash;&ndash;a scene of defeat. Life,
as he thus reviewed it, tempted him no longer; but on the
further side he perceived a quiet haven for his bark. He
paused in the passage, and looked into the shop, where
the candle still burned by the dead body. It was strangely
silent. Thoughts of the dealer swarmed into his mind as
he stood gazing. And then the bell once more broke
out into impatient clamor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He confronted the maid upon the threshold with
something like a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had better go for the police,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;I have
killed your master.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last sentence of this passage is an effect which is
logically led up to by many causes that are rapidly reviewed
in the preceding sentences. Stevenson has here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
patterned a passage of life along lines of causation; he has
employed the logical method of narration: but Pepys, in
the selection quoted, looked upon events with no narrative
sense whatever.</p>
<p><b>The Narrative Sense.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The narrative sense is, primarily,
an ability to trace an event back to its logical causes
and to look forward to its logical effects. It is the sense
through which we realize, for instance, that what happened
at two o&rsquo;clock to-day, although it may not have
resulted necessarily from what happened an hour before,
was the logical outcome of something else that happened
at noon on the preceding Thursday, let us say, and that
this in turn was the result of causes stretching back
through many months. A well-developed narrative
sense in looking on at life is very rare. Every one, of
course, is able to refer the headache of the morning after
to the hilarity if the night before; and even, after some
experience, to foresee the headache at the time of the
hilarity: but life, to the casual eye of the average man,
hides in the main the secrets of its series, and betrays
only an illogical succession of events. Minds cruder
than the average see only a jumble of happenings in
the life they look upon, and group them, if at all, by
propinquity in time, rather than by any deeper law of
relation. Such a mind had Dame Quickly, the loquacious
Hostess in Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; Consider the
famous speech in which she accuses Falstaff of breach
of promise to marry her:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet,
sitting in my Dolphin-chamber, at the round table, by a
sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when
the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing
man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was
washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Keech, the butcher&rsquo;s wife, come in then and call me gossip
Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; telling
us she had a good dish of prawns; whereby thou didst
desire to eat some; whereby I told thee they were ill for a
green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone
down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with
such poor people; saying that ere long they should call me
madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch
thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath:
deny it, if thou canst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are, of course, many deficiencies in Dame
Quickly&rsquo;s mental make-up; but the one for us to notice
here is her utter lack of the narrative sense. She would
never be able to tell a story: because, in the first place,
she could not select from a muddle of events those which
bore an intelligible relation to one another, and in the
second place, she could not arrange them logically instead
of chronologically. She has no sense of series. And
although Dame Quickly&rsquo;s mind is an exaggeration of the
type it represents, the type, in less exaggerated form, is
very common; and everybody will agree that the average
man, who has never taken pains to train himself in narrative,
is not able in his ordinary conversation to tell with
ease a logically connected story.</p>
<p><b>The Joy of Telling Tales.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The better sort of narrative
sense is not merely an abstract intellectual understanding
of the relation of cause and effect subsisting between
events often disparate in time; it is, rather, a concrete
feeling of the relation. It is an intuitive feeling;
and, being such, it is possessed instinctively by certain
minds. There are people in the world who are natural
born story-tellers; all of us have met with them in actual
life: and to this class belong the story-telling giants, like
Sir Walter Scott, Victor Hugo, Dumas p&egrave;re, Stevenson,
and Mr. Kipling. Narrative is natural to their minds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
They sense events in series; and a series once started in
their imagination propels itself with hurrying progression.
Some novelists, like Wilkie Collins, have nothing else to
recommend them but this native sense of narrative;
but it is a gift that is not to be despised. Authors with
something important to say about life have need of it,
in order that the process of reading their fiction may be,
in Stevenson&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;absorbing and voluptuous.&rdquo; In
the great story-tellers, there is a sort of self-enjoyment
in the exercise of the sense of narrative; and this, by
sheer contagion, communicates enjoyment to the reader.
Perhaps it may be called (by analogy with the familiar
phrase, &ldquo;the joy of living&rdquo;) the joy of telling tales.
The joy of telling tales which shines through &ldquo;Treasure
Island&rdquo; is perhaps the main reason for the continued
popularity of the story. The author is having such a good
time in telling his tale that he gives us necessarily a good
time in reading it.</p>
<p><b>The Missing of This Joy.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But many of the novelists
who have had great things to say about human life
have been singularly deficient in this native sense of narrative.
George Eliot and Anthony Trollope, for example,
almost never evidence the joy of telling tales.
George Eliot&rsquo;s natural habit of mind was abstract rather
than concrete; she was born an essayist. But, largely
through the influence of George Henry Lewes, she deliberately
decided that fiction was the most effective
medium for expressing her philosophy of life. Thereafter
she strove earnestly to develop that sense of narrative
which, at the outset, was largely lacking in her mind.
To many readers who are not without appreciation of
the importance and profundity of her understanding of
human nature, her stories are wearisome and unalluring,
because she told them with labor, not with ease. She
does not seem to have had a good time with them, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Stevenson had with &ldquo;Treasure Island,&rdquo; a story in other
ways of comparative unimportance. And surely it is
not frivolous to state that the most profound and serious
of thoughts are communicated best when they are communicated
with the greatest interest.</p>
<p><b>Developing the Sense of Narrative.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It could hardly
be hoped that a person entirely devoid of the narrative
sense should acquire it by any amount of labor; but
nearly every one possesses it in at least a rudimentary
degree, and any one possessing it at all may develop it
by exercise. A simple and common-sensible exercise
is to seize hold of some event that happens in our daily
lives, and then think back over all the antecedent events
we can remember, until we discern which ones among
them stand in a causal relation to the event we are considering.
Next, it will be well to look forward and
imagine the sort of events which will logically carry on
the series. The great generals of history have won their
most signal victories by an exercise of the narrative sense.
Holding at the moment of planning a campaign the past
and present terms of a logical series of events, they have
imagined forward and foreseen the probable progression
of the series. This may perhaps explain why the great
commanders, like C&aelig;sar and Grant, have written such
able narrative when they have turned to literature.</p>
<p>The young author who is trying to develop his narrative
sense may find unending exercise in the endeavor
to ferret out the various series of events which lie entangled
in the confused and apparently unrelated successions
of incidents which pass before his observation.
When he sees something happen in the street, he will
not be satisfied, like the casual looker-on, merely with
that solitary happening; he will try to find out what other
happenings led up to it, and again what other happenings
must logically follow from it. When he sees an interesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
person in a street-car, he will wonder where that
person has come from and whither he is going, what he
has just done and what he is about to do; he will look
before and after, and pine for what is not. This exercise
is in itself interesting; and if the result of it be written
down, the young author will gain experience in expression
at the same time that he is developing his sense of narrative.</p>
<p><b>The Meaning of the Word &ldquo;Event.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;It remains for
us now to consider philosophically the significance of
the word <i>event</i>. Every event has three elements: the
thing that is done, the agents that do it, and the circumstances
of time and place under which it is done; or, to
say the matter in three words,&ndash;&ndash;action, actors, and setting.
Only when all three elements conspire can something
happen. Life suggests to the mind of a contemplative
observer many possible events which remain
unrealized because only one or two of the necessary
three elements are present,&ndash;&ndash;events that are waiting, like
unborn children on the other side of Lethe, until the
necessary conditions shall call them into being. We
observe a man who could do a great thing of a certain sort
if only that sort of thing were demanded to be done at the
time and in the place in which he loiters wasted. We
grow aware of a great thing longing to be done, when
there is no one present who is capable of doing it. We
behold conditions of place and time entirely fitted for a
certain sort of happening; but nothing happens, because
the necessary people are away. &ldquo;Never the time and the
place and the loved one all together!&rdquo; sang Robert
Browning; and then he dreamed upon an event which
was waiting to be born,&ndash;&ndash;waiting for the imagined meeting
and marriage of its elements.</p>
<p><b>How to Make Things Happen.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is the function of
the master of creative narrative to call events into being.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
He does this by assembling and marrying the elements
without which events cannot occur. Granted the conception
of a character who is capable of doing certain things,
he finds things of that sort for the character to do;
granted a sense of certain things longing to be done, he
finds people who will do them; or granted the time and
the place that seem expectant of a certain sort of happening,
he finds the agents proper to the setting. There is a
conversation of Stevenson&rsquo;s, covering this point, which
has been often quoted. His biographer, Mr. Graham
Balfour, tells us: &ldquo;Either on that day or about that
time I remember very distinctly his saying to me: &lsquo;There
are, so far as I know, three ways, and three ways only, of
writing a story. You may take a plot and fit characters
to it, or you may take a character and choose incidents
and situations to develop it, or lastly&ndash;&ndash;you must bear
with me while I try to make this clear&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;(here he made a
gesture with his hand as if he were trying to shape something
and give it outline and form)&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;you may take a
certain atmosphere and get action and persons to express
it and realize it. I&rsquo;ll give you an example&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The Merry
Men.&rdquo; There I began with the feeling of one of those
islands on the west coast of Scotland, and I gradually
developed the story to express the sentiment with which
the coast affected me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, starting with any one of the three
elements&ndash;&ndash;action, actors, or setting&ndash;&ndash;the writer of narrative
may create events by imagining the other two.
Comparatively speaking, there have been very few stories,
like &ldquo;The Merry Men,&rdquo; in which the author has
started out from a sense of setting; and nearly all of them
have been written recently. The feeling for setting as
the initial element in narrative hardly dates back further
than the nineteenth century. We may therefore best
consider it in a later and more special chapter, and devote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
our attention for the present to the two methods of creating
narrative that have been most often used&ndash;&ndash;that in
which the author has started with the element of action,
and that in which he has started with the element of
character.</p>
<p>Very few of the great masters of narrative have, like
Honor&eacute; de Balzac, employed both one and the other
method with equal success: nearly all of them have shown
an habitual mental predilection for the one or for the
other. The elder Dumas, for example, habitually devised a
scheme of action and then selected characters to fit into
his plot; and George Meredith habitually created characters
and then devised the elements of action necessary
to exhibit and develop them. Readers, like the novelists
themselves, usually feel a predilection for one method
rather than the other; but surely each method is natural
and reasonable, and it would be injudicious for the critic
to exalt either of them at the expense of the other. There
is plenty of material in life to allure a mind of either habit.
Certain things that are done are in themselves so interesting
that it matters comparatively little who is doing
them; and certain characters are in themselves so interesting
that it matters comparatively little what they do.
To conceive a potent train of action and thereby foreordain
the nature of such characters as will accomplish
it, or to conceive characters pregnant with potentiality
for certain sorts of deeds and thereby foreordain a train
of action,&ndash;&ndash;either is a legitimate method for planning out a
narrative. That method is best for any author which
is most natural for him; he will succeed best working in
his own way; and that critic is not catholic who states
that either the narrative of action or the narrative of
character is a better type of work than the other. The
truth of human life may be told equally well by those
who sense primarily its element of action and by those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
who sense primarily its element of character; for both
elements must finally appear commingled in any story
that is real.</p>
<p>The critic may, however, make a philosophical distinction
between the two methods, in order to lead to a better
understanding of them both. Those writers who sense life
primarily as action may be said to work from the outside
in; and those who sense it primarily as character may be
said to work from the inside out. The first method requires
the more objective, and the second the more subjective,
consciousness of life. Of the two, the objective
consciousness of life is (at its weakest) more elementary
and (at its strongest) more elemental than the subjective.</p>
<p><b>The Narrative of Action.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Stevenson, in his &ldquo;Gossip
on Romance,&rdquo; has eloquently voiced the potency of an
objective sense of action as the initial factor in the development
of a narrative. He is speaking of the spell
cast over him by certain books he read in boyhood.
&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I liked a story to begin with an
old wayside inn where, &lsquo;towards the close of the year
17&ndash;&ndash;,&rsquo; several gentlemen in three-cocked hats were playing
bowls. A friend of mine preferred the Malabar coast
in a storm, with a ship beating to windward, and a
scowling fellow of Herculean proportions striding along
the beach; he, to be sure, was a pirate. This was further
afield than my home-keeping fancy loved to travel, and
designed altogether for a larger canvas than the tales that
I affected. Give me a highwayman and I was full to
the brim; a Jacobite would do, but the highwayman was
my favourite dish. I can still hear that merry clatter of
the hoofs along the moonlit lane; night and the coming
of day are still related in my mind with the doings of
John Rann or Jerry Abershaw; and the words &lsquo;post-chaise,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;great north road,&rsquo; &lsquo;ostler,&rsquo; and &lsquo;nag&rsquo; still
sound in my ears like poetry. One and all, at least, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
each with his particular fancy, we read story-books in
childhood, not for eloquence or character or thought, but
for some quality of the brute incident.&rdquo; For the writer
who works from the outside in, it is entirely possible to
develop from &ldquo;some quality of the brute incident&rdquo; a
narrative that shall be not only stirring in its propulsion
of events but also profound in its significance of elemental
truth.</p>
<p><b>The Narrative of Character.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The method of working
from the inside out&ndash;&ndash;of using a subjective sense of character
as the initial factor in the development of a narrative&ndash;&ndash;is
wonderfully exemplified in the work of Ivan
Turg&eacute;nieff; and the method is very clearly explained in
Henry James&rsquo; intimate essay on the great Russian master.
Henry James remarks: &ldquo;The germ of a story, with
him, was never an affair of plot&ndash;&ndash;that was the last thing
he thought of: it was the representation of certain persons.
The first form in which a tale appeared to him
was as the figure of an individual, or a combination of
individuals, whom he wished to see in action, being sure
that such people must do something very special and interesting.
They stood before him definite, vivid, and
he wished to know, and to show, as much as possible of
their nature. The first thing was to make clear to himself
what he did know, to begin with; and to this end he
wrote out a sort of biography of each of his characters,
and everything that they had done and that had happened
to them up to the opening of the story. He had
their <i>dossier</i>, as the French say, and as the police has
of that of every conspicuous criminal. With this material
in his hand he was able to proceed; the story all
lay in the question, What shall I make them do? He
always made them do things that showed them completely;
but, as he said, the defect of his manner and the
reproach that was made him was his want of &lsquo;architecture&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
other words, of composition. The great thing,
of course, is to have architecture as well as precious
material, as Walter Scott had them, as Balzac had them.
If one reads Turg&eacute;nieff&rsquo;s stories with the knowledge that
they were composed&ndash;&ndash;or rather that they came into
being&ndash;&ndash;in this way, one can trace the process in every
line. Story, in the conventional sense of the word&ndash;&ndash;a
fable constructed, like Wordsworth&rsquo;s phantom, &lsquo;to
startle and waylay&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;there is as little as possible. The
thing consists of the motions of a group of selected
creatures, which are not the result of a preconceived action,
but a consequence of the qualities of the actors.&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;And
yet, for the writer who, like Turg&eacute;nieff, works from
the inside out, it is entirely possible to develop from
&ldquo;the qualities of the actors&rdquo; a train of action that shall
be as stirring as it is significant.</p>
<p><b>Recapitulation.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The main principle of narrative to
bear in mind is that action alone, or character alone, is
not its proper subject-matter. The purpose of narrative
is to represent events; and an event occurs only when
both character and action, with contributory setting, are
assembled and commingled. Indeed, in the greatest
and most significant events, it is impossible to decide
whether the actor or the action has the upper hand; it is
impossible, in regarding such events, for the imagination
to conceive what is done and who is doing it as elements
divorced. A novelist who has started out with either
element and has afterward evoked the other may arrive
by imagination at this final complete sense of an event.
The best narratives of action and of character are indistinguishable,
one from another, in their ultimate result:
they differ only in their origin: and the author who aspires
to a mastery of narrative should remember that,
in narrative at its best, character and action and even
setting are one and inseparable.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>For the conveniences of study, however, it is well to
examine the elements of narrative one by one; and we
shall therefore devote three separate chapters to a technical
consideration of plot, and characters, and setting.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Narrative a Simplification of Life.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Robert Louis
Stevenson, in his spirited essay entitled &ldquo;A Humble
Remonstrance,&rdquo; has given very valuable advice to the
writer of narrative. In concluding his remarks he says,
&ldquo;And as the root of the whole matter, let him bear in
mind that his novel is not a transcript of life, to be judged
by its exactitude; but a simplification of some side or
point of life, to stand or fall by its significant simplicity.
For although, in great men, working upon great motives,
what we observe and admire is often their complexity,
yet underneath appearances the truth remains unchanged:
that simplification was their method, and that simplicity
is their excellence.&rdquo; Indeed, as we have already noted
in passing, simplification is the method of every art.
Every artist, in his own way, simplifies life: first by selecting
essentials from the helter-skelter of details that
life presents to him, and then by arranging these essentials
in accordance with a pattern. And we have
noted also that the method of the artist in narrative
is to select events which bear an essential logical relation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
to each other and then to arrange them along the lines
of a pattern of causation.</p>
<p><b>Unity in Narrative.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Of course the prime structural
necessity in narrative, as indeed in every method of discourse,
is unity. Unity in any work of art can be attained
only by a definite decision of the artist as to what
he is trying to accomplish, and by a rigorous focus of
attention on his purpose to accomplish it,&ndash;&ndash;a focus of
attention so rigorous as to exclude consideration of any
matter which does not contribute, directly or indirectly,
to the furtherance of his aim. The purpose of the artist
in narrative is to represent a series of events,&ndash;&ndash;wherein
each event stands in a causal relation, direct or indirect,
to its logical predecessor and its logical successor in the
series. Obviously the only way to attain unity of narrative
is to exclude consideration of any event which does
not, directly or indirectly, contribute to the progress of
the series. For this reason, Stevenson states in his advice
to the young writer, from which we have already
quoted: &ldquo;Let him choose a motive, whether of character
or passion: carefully construct his plot so that every incident
is an illustration of the motive, and every property
employed shall bear to it a near relation of congruity or
contrast; ... and allow neither himself in the
narrative, nor any character in the course of the dialogue,
to utter one sentence that is not part and parcel
of the business of the story or the discussion of the problem
involved. Let him not regret if this shortens his book;
it will be better so; for to add irrelevant matter is not to
lengthen but to bury. Let him not mind if he miss a
thousand qualities, so that he keeps unflaggingly in pursuit
of the one he has chosen.&rdquo; And earlier in the same
essay, he says of the novel: &ldquo;For the welter of impressions,
all forcible but all discreet, which life presents, it substitutes
a certain artificial series of impressions, all indeed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
most feebly represented, but all aiming at the same effect,
all eloquent of the same idea, all chiming together like
consonant notes in music or like the graduated tints in a
good picture. From all its chapters, from all its pages,
from all its sentences, the well-written novel echoes and
re-echoes its one creative and controlling thought; to this
must every incident and character contribute; the style
must have been pitched in unison with this; and if there
is anywhere a word that looks another way, the book
would be stronger, clearer, and (I had almost said) fuller
without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>A Definite Objective Point.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The only way in which
the writer of narrative may attain the unity that Stevenson
has so eloquently pleaded for is to decide upon a
definite objective point, to bear in mind constantly the
culmination of his series of events, and to value the successive
details of his material only in so far as they
contribute, directly or indirectly, to the progress of the
series toward that culmination. To say the thing more
simply, he must see the end of his story from the beginning
and must give the reader always a sense of rigorous
movement toward that end. His narrative, as a matter
of construction, must be finished, before, as a matter of
writing, it is begun. He must know as definitely as
possible all that is to happen and all that is not to happen
in his story before he ventures to represent in words the
very first of his events. He must not, as some beginners
try to do, attempt to make his story up as he goes along;
for unless he holds the culmination of his series constantly
in mind, he will not be able to decide whether any event
that suggests itself during the progress of his composition
does or does not form a logical factor in the series.</p>
<p><b>Construction, Analytic and Synthetic.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The preliminary
process of construction may be accomplished in either
of two ways. Authors with synthetic minds will more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
naturally reason from causes to effects; and authors with
analytic minds will more naturally reason from effects
to causes. The former will construct forward through
time, the latter backward. Standing at the outset of a
narrative, it is possible to imagine forward along a series
of events until the logical culmination is divined; or
standing at the culmination, it is possible to imagine
backward along the series to its far-away beginnings.
Thackeray apparently constructed in the former manner;
Guy de Maupassant apparently constructed in the latter.
The latter method&ndash;&ndash;the method of building backward
from the culmination&ndash;&ndash;is perhaps more efficacious toward
the conservation of the strictest unity. It seems on the
whole a little easier to exclude the extraneous in thinking
from effects to causes than in thinking from causes to
effects, because analysis is a stricter and more focussed
mood of mind than synthesis.</p>
<p><b>The Importance of Structure.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But in whichever way
the process of construction be accomplished, the best
stories are always built before they are written; and
that is the reason why, in reading them, we feel at every
point that we are getting somewhere, and that the
author is leading us step by step toward a definite culmination.
Although, as is usually the case, we cannot,
even midway through the story, foresee what the culmination
is to be, we feel a certain reassurance in the
knowledge that the author has foreseen it from the start.
This feeling is one of the main sources of interest in reading
narrative. In looking on at life itself, we are baffled
by a muddle of events leading every whither; their
succession is chaotic and lacking in design; they are not
marshaled and processional; and we have an uncomfortable
feeling that no mind but that of God can foresee
their veiled and hidden culminations. But in reading
a narrative arrangement of life, we have a comfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
sense of order, which comes of our knowledge that the
author knows beforehand whither the events are tending
and can make us understand the sequence of causation
through which they are moving to their ultimate result.
He makes life more interesting by making it more intelligible;
and he does this mainly by his power of construction.</p>
<p><b>Elementary Narrative.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The simplest of all structures
for a narrative is a straightway arrangement of events
along a single strand of causation. In such a narrative,
the first event is the direct cause of the second, the second
of the third, the third of the fourth, and so on to the culmination
of the series. This very simple structure is
exhibited in many of the tales which have come down to
us from early centuries. It is frequently employed in
the &ldquo;Gesta Romanorum,&rdquo; and scarcely less frequently
in the &ldquo;Decameron&rdquo; of Boccaccio. It has the advantage
of being completely logical and entirely direct. But we
feel, in reading stories so constructed, that the method
of simplification has been carried too far, and that simplicity
has therefore ceased to be an excellence. Such a
story is in this way misrepresentative of life:&ndash;&ndash;it fails
utterly to suggest &ldquo;the welter of impressions which life
presents,&rdquo; the sudden kaleidoscopic shifts of actual life
from one series of events to another, and the consequent
intricacy and apparent chaos of life&rsquo;s successive happenings.
The structure is too straightforward, too direct,
too unwavering and unhesitant.</p>
<p><b>Positive and Negative Events.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The simplest way to
introduce the element of hesitance and wavering, and
thereby make the story more truly suggestive of the
intricate variety of life, is to interrupt the series by the
introduction of events whose apparent tendency is to
hinder its progress, and in this way emphasize the ultimate
triumph of the series in attaining its predestined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
culmination. Such events are not extraneous; because,
although they tend directly to dispute the progress of the
series, they tend also indirectly to further it through their
failure to arrest it. The events in any skilfully selected
narrative may, therefore, be divided into two classes:
events direct or positive, and events indirect or negative.
By a direct, or positive, event is meant one whose immediate
tendency is to aid the progress of the series toward
its predetermined objective point; and by an indirect,
or negative, event is meant one whose immediate tendency
is to thwart this predetermined outcome. It would
be an easy matter, for example, in examining &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress,&rdquo; to class as positive those events which directly
further the advance of Christian toward the
Celestial City, and to class as negative those events
whose immediate tendency is to turn him aside from the
straight and narrow path. And yet both classes of
events, positive and negative, make up really only a single
series; because the negative events are conquered one by
one by the preponderant power of the positive events,
and contribute therefore indirectly, through their failure,
to the ultimate attainment of the culmination.</p>
<p>When a straightway arrangement of positive events
along a single strand of causation is varied and emphasized
in this way by the admission of negative events,
whose tendency is to thwart the progress of the series, the
structure may be made very suggestive of that conflict
of forces which we feel to be ever present in actual life.
This structure is exhibited, for example, in Hawthorne&rsquo;s
little tale of &ldquo;David Swan.&rdquo; The point of the story is
that nothing happens to David; the interest of the story
lies in the events that almost happen to him. The young
man falls asleep at noon-time under the shade of a
clump of maples which cluster around a spring beside
the highroad. Three people, or sets of people, observe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
him in his sleep. The first would confer upon him
Wealth, the second Love, the third Death, if he should
waken at the moment. But David Swan sleeps deeply;
the people pass on; and all that almost happened to
him subsides forever to the region of the might-have-been.</p>
<p><b>The Picaresque Pattern.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A simple series of this sort,
wherein the events proceed, now directly, now indirectly,
along a single logical line, may be succeeded by another
simple series of the same sort, which in turn may be succeeded
by a third, and so on indefinitely. In this way
is constructed the type of story known as picaresque,
because in Spain, where the type was first developed, the
hero was usually a <i>picaro</i>, or rogue. The narrative expedient
in such stories is merely to select a hero capable
of adventure, to fling him loose into the roaring and tremendous
world, and to let things happen to him one after
another. The most widely known example of the type
is not a Spanish story, but a French,&ndash;&ndash;the &ldquo;Gil Blas&rdquo; of
Alain Ren&eacute; Le Sage. As soon as Gil Blas arrives at the
culmination of one series of adventures, the author starts
him on another. Each series is complete in itself and
distinct from all the rest; and the structure of the whole
book may be likened, in a homely figure, to a string of
sausages. The relation between the different sections of
the story is not organic; they are merely tied together by
the continuance of the same central character from one to
another. Any one of the sections might be discarded
without detriment to the others; and the order of them
might be rearranged. Plays, as well as novels, have
been constructed in this inorganic way,&ndash;&ndash;for example,
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rsquo;Etourdi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Les Facheux.&rdquo; If the
actors, in performing either of these plays, should omit
one or two units of the sausage-string of incidents, the
audience would not become aware of any gap in structure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Yet a story built in this straightforward and successive
way may give a vast impression of the shifting
maze of life. Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kim,&rdquo; which is picaresque
in structure, shows us nearly every aspect of the labyrinthine
life of India. He selects a healthy and normal, but
not a clever, boy, and allows all India to happen to him.
The book is without beginning and without end; but its
very lack of neatness and compactness of plan contributes
to the general impression it gives of India&rsquo;s immensity.</p>
<p><b>Definition of Plot.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But a simple series of events
arranged along a single strand of causation, or a succession
of several series of this kind strung along one after
the other, may not properly be called a plot. The word
<i>plot</i> signifies a weaving together; and a weaving together
presupposes the coexistence of more than one strand.
The simplest form of plot, properly so called, is a weaving
together of two distinct series of events; and the simplest
way of weaving them together is by so devising them
that, though they may be widely separate at their beginnings,
they progress, each in its own way, toward a common
culmination,&ndash;&ndash;a single momentous event which
stands therefore at the apex of each series. This event
is the knot which ties together the two strands of causation.
Thus, in &ldquo;Silas Marner,&rdquo; the culminating event,
which is the redemption of Marner from a misanthropic
aloofness from life, through the influence of Eppie, a
child in need of love, is led up to by two distinct series of
events, of which it forms the knot. The one series, which
concerns itself with Marner, may be traced back to the
unmerited wrong which he suffered in his youth; and
the other series, which concerns itself with Eppie, may
be traced back to the clandestine marriage of Eppie&rsquo;s
father, Godfrey Cass. The initial event of one series
has no immediate logical relation to the initial event of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
the other; but each series, as it progresses, approaches
nearer and nearer to the other, until they meet and
blend.</p>
<p><b>Complication of the Network.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A type of plot more
elaborate than this may be devised by leading up to the
culmination along three or more distinct lines of causation,
instead of merely two. In the &ldquo;Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo;
Sydney Carton&rsquo;s voluntary death upon the scaffold
stands at the apex of several series of events. And a
plot may be still further complicated by tying the strands
together at other points beside the culmination. In
&ldquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rdquo; the two chief series of events
are firmly knotted in the trial scene, when Shylock
is circumvented by Portia; but they are also tied together,
though less firmly, at the very outset of the play, when
Antonio borrows from Shylock the money which makes
it possible for Bassanio to woo and win the Lady of Belmont.
Furthermore, any event in one of the main
strands of causation may stand at the culmination of
a minor strand, and thus may form a little knot in the
general network of the plot. In the same play, the minor
strand of the elopement of Lorenzo and Jessica attains
its culmination in a scene which stands only midway
along the progress of the two main strands, that of the
bond and that of the caskets, toward their common
result in the defeat of Shylock.</p>
<p><b>The Major Knot.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But however intricately woven a
plot may be, and however many minor knots may tie
together the various strands which enter into it, there is
almost always one point of greatest complication, one
big knot which ties together all the strands at once, and
stands as the common culmination of all the series,
major and minor. The story concerns itself chiefly
with telling the reader how the major knot came to be
tied; but in a plot of any complexity, the reader naturally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
desires to be told how the knot became untied again.
Therefore this point of greatest complication, this culmination
of all the strands of causation which are woven
in the plot, this objective point of the entire narrative,
is seldom set at the very end of a story, but usually at a
point about three quarters of the way from the beginning
to the end. The first three quarters of the story, speaking
roughly, exhibit the antecedent causes of the major
knot; and the last quarter of the story exhibits its subsequent
effects. A plot, therefore, in its general aspects,
may be figured as a complication followed by an explication,
a tying followed by an untying, or (to say the same
thing in French words which are perhaps more connotative)
a <i>nouement</i> followed by a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. The
events in the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> bear a closer logical relation
to each other than the events in the <i>nouement</i>, because
all of them have a common cause in the major knot,
whereas the major knot is the ultimate effect of several
distinct series of causes which were quite separate one
from another at the time when the <i>nouement</i> was begun.
For this reason the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> shows usually a more hurried
movement than the <i>nouement</i>&ndash;&ndash;one event treading on
another&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;Beginning, Middle, and End.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;Undoubtedly it
was this threefold aspect of a plot&ndash;&ndash;1. <i>The Complication</i>;
2. <i>The Major Knot</i>; 3. <i>The Explication</i>&ndash;&ndash;which Aristotle
had in mind when he stated that every story must have
a beginning, a middle, and an end. These words were
not intended to connote a quantitative equality. What
Aristotle called the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; may, in a modern novel,
be stated in a single page, and is much more likely to
stand near the close of the book than at the centre. But
everything that comes after it, in what Aristotle called
the &ldquo;end,&rdquo; should be an effect of which it is the cause;
and everything that comes before it, in what Aristotle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
called the &ldquo;beginning,&rdquo; should be, directly or indirectly,
a cause of which it is the effect. Only under these conditions
will the plot be, as Aristotle said it should be, an
organic whole. Only in this way can it conform to the
principle of unity, which is the first principle of all artistic
endeavor.</p>
<p><b>The Sub-Plot.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Bearing the principle of unity ever
in his mind, Stevenson, in a phrase omitted for the moment
in one of the quotations from &ldquo;A Humble Remonstrance&rdquo;
set forth at the beginning of this chapter, advised
the fiction-writer to &ldquo;avoid a sub-plot, unless, as sometimes
in Shakespeare, the sub-plot be a reversion or complement
of the main intrigue.&rdquo; It seems safe to state
that a sub-plot is of use in a novel only for the purpose of
tying minor knots in the leading strands of causation,
and should be discarded unless it serves that purpose.
There is no reason, however, why a novel should not tell
at once several stories of equal importance, provided
that these stories be deftly interlinked, as in that masterpiece
of plotting, &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend.&rdquo; In this novel,
the chief expedient which Dickens has employed to bind
his different stories together is to make the same person
an actor in more than one of them, so that a particular
event that happens to him may be at the same time a
factor in both one and the other series of events. Through
the skilful use of this expedient, Dickens has contrived
to give his novel unity of plot, in spite of the diversity
of its narrative elements. But on the other hand, in
&ldquo;Middlemarch,&rdquo; George Eliot has told three stories
instead of one. She has failed to make her plot an organic
whole by deftly interweaving the three strands
which she has spun. And therefore this monumental
novel, so great in other ways, is faulty in structure, because
it violates the principle of unity.</p>
<p><b>Discursive and Compacted Narratives.</b>&ndash;&ndash;According
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
to the extent of complication in the plot, novels may
be grouped into two classes,&ndash;&ndash;the discursive and the
compacted. Thackeray wrote novels of the former
type, Hawthorne of the latter. In &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; there
are over half a hundred characters; in &ldquo;The Scarlet
Letter&rdquo; there are three, or possibly four. The discursive
novel gives a more extensive, and the compacted novel a
more intensive, view of life. English authors for the
most part have tended toward the discursive type, and
Continental authors toward the compacted. The latter
type demands a finer and a firmer art, the former a
broader and more catholic outlook on the world.</p>
<p><b>Telling Much or Little of a Story.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The distinction
between the two types depends chiefly upon how much
or how little of his entire story the author chooses to
tell. In actual life, as was stated in a former chapter,
there are no very ends; and it may now be added that also
there are no absolute beginnings. Any event that happens
is, in Whitman&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;an acme of things accomplished&rdquo;
and &ldquo;an encloser of things to be&rdquo;; and in
thinking back along its causes or forward along its effects,
we may continue the series until our thought loses itself
in an eternity. In any narrative, therefore, we are doomed
to begin and end in mid-career; and the question is merely
how extended a section of the entire imaginable and
unimaginable series we shall choose to represent to the
reader. For instance, it would be a very simple matter
to trace the composition of Rossetti&rsquo;s &ldquo;House of Life&rdquo;
back along a causal series to the birth of a boy in Arezzo
in 1304; for it is hardly likely that Rossetti would have
written a cycle of love sonnets if many other poets, such
as Shakespeare and Ronsard, had not done so before him;
and Shakespeare and Ronsard, as Sir Sidney Lee has
proved, were literary legatees of Petrarch, the aforesaid
native of Arezzo. And yet, if we were to tell the story of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
how Rossetti&rsquo;s sonnets came to be composed, it is
doubtful if we should go further back in time than the
occasion when his friend Deverell introduced him to the
beautiful daughter of a Sheffield cutler who became the
immediate inspiration of his poetry of love.</p>
<p>Dickens, in many novels, of which &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo;
may be taken as an example, has chosen to tell the
entire life-story of his hero from birth up to maturity.
But other novelists, like George Meredith in &ldquo;The
Egoist,&rdquo; have chosen to represent events that pass, for
the most part, in one place, and in an exceedingly short
stretch of time. It is by no means certain that Meredith
does not know as much about the boyhood and youth of
Sir Willoughby Patterne as Dickens knew about the
early years of David Copperfield; but he has chosen to
compact his novel by presenting only a brief series of
events which exhibit his hero at maturity. Surely
Turg&eacute;nieff, after writing out that <i>dossier</i> of each of his
characters to which Henry James referred, must have
known a great many events in their lives which he chose
to omit from his finished novel. It is interesting to
imagine the sort of plot that George Eliot would have
built out of the materials of &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter.&rdquo; Probably
she would have begun the narrative in England at
the time when Hester was a young girl. She would
have set forth the meeting of Hester and Chillingworth
and would have analyzed the causes culminating in
their marriage. Then she would have taken the couple
overseas to the colony of Massachusetts. Here Hester
would have met Arthur Dimmesdale; and George Eliot
would have expended all her powers as an analyst of
life in tracing the sweet thoughts and imperious desires
that led the lovers to the dolorous pass. The fall of
Hester would have been the major knot in George
Eliot&rsquo;s entire narrative. It would have stood at the culmination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
of the <i>nouement</i> of her plot: the subsequent
events would have been merely steps in the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.
Yet the fall of Hester was already a thing of the past at
the outset of the story that Hawthorne chose to represent.
He was interested only in the after-effects of
Hester&rsquo;s sin upon herself and her lover and her husband.
The major knot, or culmination, of his plot was therefore
the revelation of the scarlet letter,&ndash;&ndash;a scene which would
have been only an incident in George Eliot&rsquo;s <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.
It will be seen from this that any story which is extended
in its implications may offer a novelist materials for any
one of several plot-structures, according to whichever
section of the entire story happens most to interest his
mind.</p>
<p>It will be seen, also, that much of the entire story must,
in any case, remain unwritten. A plot is not only, as
Stevenson stated, a simplification of life; it is also a
further simplification of the train of events which, in
simplifying life, the novelist has first imagined. The
entire story, with all its implications, is selected from life;
and the plot is then selected from the entire story. Often
a novelist may suggest as much through deliberately
omitting from his plot certain events in his imagined
story as he could suggest by representing them. Perhaps
the most powerful character in George Meredith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Evan Harrington&rdquo; is the great Mel, whose death is
announced in the very first sentence of the novel. Hawthorne,
in &ldquo;The Marble Faun,&rdquo; never clears away the
mystery of Miriam&rsquo;s shadowy pursuer, nor tells us what
became of Hilda when she disappeared for a time from
the sight and knowledge of her friends.</p>
<p><b>Where to Begin a Story.</b>&ndash;&ndash;After the novelist has selected
from his entire story the materials he means to
represent, and has patterned these materials into a plot,
he enjoys considerable liberty in regard to the point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
at which he may commence his narrative. He may begin
at the beginning of one or another of his main strands
of causation, as Scott usually does; or he may adopt the
Homeric device, commended by Horace, of plunging into
the midst of his plot and working his way back only
afterward to its beginning. In the first chapter of
&ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; the hero is seventeen years old; the second
chapter narrates the marriage of his father and mother,
and his own birth and boyhood; and at the outset of the
third chapter he is only sixteen years of age.</p>
<p><b>Logical Sequence and Chronological Succession.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It
is obvious that, so long as the novelist represents his
events in logical sequence, it is not at all necessary that
he should present them in chronological succession.
Stories may be told backward through time as well as
forward. Thackeray often begins a chapter with an
event that happened one day, and ends it with an event
that happened several days before; he works his way
backward from effects to causes, instead of forward from
causes to effects. In carrying on a plot which is woven
out of several strands, it is hardly ever possible to represent
events in uninterrupted chronological succession,
even when the author consistently works forward from
causes to effects; for after he has pursued one strand of
his plot to a certain point in time, he is obliged to turn
backward several days or weeks, or possibly a longer
period, to pick up another strand and carry it forward
to the same point in time at which he left the first.
Retrogression in time, therefore, is frequently not only
permissible but necessary. But it is only common-sensible
to state that chronological sequence should be
sacrificed merely for the sake of making clear the logical
relation of events; and whenever juggling with chronology
tends to obscure instead of clarify that logical relation,
it is evidence of an error of judgment on the part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
the narrator. Turg&eacute;nieff is often guilty of this error of
judgment. He has a disconcerting habit of bringing a
new character into the scene which stands for the moment
before the eye of the reader, and then turning the narrative
backward several years in order to recount the past
life of the newcomer. Frequently, before this parenthetic
recital is completed, the reader has forgotten the
scene from which the author turned to the digression.</p>
<p><b>Tying and Untying.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In most plots, as has been stated,
the <i>nouement</i> is more significant than the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>,
and the causes leading to the tying of the major knot are
more interesting than the effects traced during the process
of untying it. This is the reason why the culmination
is usually set well along toward the conclusion of the
story. Sometimes even, when the major knot has been
tied with a Gordian intricacy, the author sets it at the
very end of his narrative, and suddenly cuts it instead of
carefully untying it. But there is no absolutely necessary
reason why it should stand at the end, or, as is
more frequently the case, at a point about three quarters
through the story. It may even be set at the very beginning;
and the narrative may concern itself entirely
with an elaborate <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. This is the case, for example,
in the detective story, where a very intricate knot
is assumed at the outset, and the narrative proceeds to
exhibit the prowess of the detective-hero in untying it.</p>
<p><b>Transition to the Next Chapter.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A well-constructed
plot, like any other sort of well-articulated pattern, is
interesting in itself; and certain novels and short-stories,
like Wilkie Collins&rsquo; &ldquo;Moonstone&rdquo; and Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Murders in
the Rue Morgue,&rdquo; maintain their interest almost through
the element of plot alone. But since the purpose of
fiction is to represent reality, a story will fail of the highest
effect unless the people acting in its pattern of events
produce upon the reader the illusion of living human beings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
We must therefore turn our attention next to a
study of the element of character.</p>

of the Audience&ndash;&ndash;The Universal Appeal of Great Fictitious
Characters&ndash;&ndash;Typical Traits&ndash;&ndash;Individual Traits&ndash;&ndash;The Defect of

</blockquote>
<p><b>Characters Should Be Worth Knowing.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Before we
proceed to study the technical methods of delineating
characters, we must ask ourselves what constitutes a
character worth delineating. A novelist is, to speak
figuratively, the social sponsor for his own fictitious
characters; and he is guilty of a social indiscretion, as it
were, if he asks his readers to meet fictitious people
whom it is neither of value nor of interest to know. Since
he aims to make his readers intimate with his characters,
he must first of all be careful that his characters are worth
knowing intimately. Most of us, in actual life, are
accustomed to distinguish people who are worth our
while from people who are not; and those of us who live
advisedly are accustomed to shield ourselves from people
who cannot, by the mere fact of what they are, repay us
for the expenditure of time and energy we should have to
make to get to know them. And whenever a friend of
ours asks us deliberately to meet another friend of his,
we take it for granted that our friend has reasons for believing
that the acquaintanceship will be of benefit or of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
interest to both. Now the novelist stands in the position
of a friend who asks us to meet certain people whom he
knows; and he runs the risk of our losing faith in his
judgment unless we find his people worth our while.
By the mere fact that we bother to read a novel, thus
expending time which might otherwise be passed in company
with actual people, we are going out of our way to
meet the characters to whom the novelist wishes to introduce
us. He therefore owes us an assurance that they
shall be even more worth our while than the average
actual person. This is not to say that they should necessarily
be better; they may, of course, be worse: but they
should be more clearly significant of certain interesting
elements of human nature, more thoroughly representative
of certain phases of human life which it is well for
us to learn and know.</p>
<p><b>The Personal Equation of the Audience.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In deciding
on the sort of characters that will be worth his readers&rsquo;
while, the novelist must of course be influenced by the
nature of the audience he is writing for. The characters
of &ldquo;Little Women&rdquo; may be worth the while of
children; and it is not an adverse criticism of Louisa
M. Alcott to say that they are not worth the while of
mature men and women. Similarly, it is not an adverse
criticism of certain Continental novelists to say that
their characters are decidedly unfit companions for adolescent
girls. Our judgment of the characters in a novel
should be conditioned always by our sense of the sort of
readers to whom the novel is addressed. Henry James,
in his later years, wrote usually for the super-civilized;
and his characters should be judged by different standards
than the pirates of &ldquo;Treasure Island,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a story
which was written for boys, both young and old. One
reader may be bored by pirates, another by super-subtle
cosmopolitans; and each reader has the privilege of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
avoiding the society of the characters that weary
him.</p>
<p><b>The Universal Appeal of Great Fictitious Characters.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But
the very greatest characters of fiction are worth
everybody&rsquo;s while; and surely the masters need have felt
no hesitancy in asking any one to meet Sancho Panza,
Robinson Crusoe, Henry Esmond, Jean Valjean, or
Terence Mulvaney. In fact, the most amazing thing
about a great fictitious figure is the multitude of very
different people that the character is capable of interesting.
Many times we willingly absent ourselves from
actual society to pass an evening in the company of a
fictitious personage of a class with which we never associate
in actual life. Perhaps in the actual world we would
never bother to converse with illiterate provincial people;
and yet we may not feel it a waste of time and energy to
meet them in the pages of &ldquo;Middlemarch.&rdquo; For my own
part, I have always, in actual life, avoided meeting the
sort of people that appear in Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo;;
and yet I find it not only interesting but profitable to
associate with them through the entire extent of a rather
lengthy novel. Why is it that a reader, who, although he
has crossed the ocean many times, has never cared to
enter the engine-room of a liner, is yet willing enough to
meet on intimate terms Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s engineer, Mac
Andrew? And why is it that ladies who, in actual society,
are fastidious of their acquaintanceship, should yet
associate throughout a novel with the Sapho of Daudet?
What is the reason why these fictitious characters should
seem, for nearly every reader, more worth while than the
very same sort of people in actual life?</p>
<p><b>Typical Traits.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The reason is that great fictitious
characters are typical of their class, to an extent rarely
to be noticed in any actual member of the class they
typify. They &ldquo;contain multitudes,&rdquo; to borrow Whitman&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
phrase. All idealistic visionaries are typified in
Don Quixote, all misers in Harpagon, all hypocrites in
Tartufe, all egoists in Sir Willoughby Patterne, all clever,
tricksy women in Becky Sharp, all sentimentalists in
Barrie&rsquo;s Tommy. But the average actual man is not of
sufficient magnitude to contain a multitude of others; he
is comparatively lacking in typical traits; he is not, to
such a great extent, illustrative of life, because only in a
small measure is he representative of his class. There
are, of course, in actual life, certain people of unusual
magnitude who justify Emerson&rsquo;s title of &ldquo;Representative
Men.&rdquo; Benjamin Franklin, for example, is such
a man. He is the only actual person entirely typical of
eighteenth-century America; and that is the main reason
why, as an exhibition of character, his autobiography is
just as profitable a book as the master-works of fiction.
But men so representative are rare in actual life; and the
chief business of fiction is therefore to supply them.</p>
<p><b>Individual Traits.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is mainly by supplying this
need for representative men and women that the novelist
can make his characters worth the while of every reader.
But after he has made them quintessential of a class, he
must be careful also to individualize them. Unless he
endows them with certain personal traits that distinguish
them from all other representatives or members of their
class, whether actual or fictitious, he will fail to invest
them with the illusion of reality. Every great character
of fiction must exhibit, therefore, an intimate combination
of typical and individual traits. It is through being
typical that the character is true; it is through being
individual that the character is convincing.</p>
<p><b>The Defect of Allegory.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The reason why most allegorical
figures are ineffective is that, although they are
typical, they are not at the same time individual. They
are abstractly representative of a class; but they are not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
concretely distinguishable from other representatives or
members of the class. We know them, therefore, not as
persons but merely as ideas. We feel very little human
interest nowadays in reading over the old morality plays,
whose characters are merely allegorical abstractions.
But in criticising them we must remember that they were
designed not so much to be read as to be performed upon
the stage; and that the actors who represented their
abstract and merely typical characters must necessarily
have endowed them with concreteness and with individuality.
Though a character in one of these allegorical
plays might be called &ldquo;Everyman,&rdquo; it was one particular
man who walked and talked upon the boards; and he
evoked sympathy not so much for the type as for the individual.
But allegory written to be read is less likely
to produce the illusion of reality; and it is only when allegorical
characters are virtually conceived as individuals,
instead of mere abstractions, that they touch the heart.
Christian, in Bunyan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; is so conceived.
He is entirely representative of seventeenth-century
Christianity; in a sense he is all men of Bunyan&rsquo;s
time and Bunyan&rsquo;s religion; but he is also one man and
one only, and we could never in our thought confuse him
with any other character in or out of fiction.</p>
<p><b>The Defect of Caricature.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But just as a character
may be ineffective through being merely typical, so also
a character may be unsignificant through being merely
individual. The minor figures in Ben Jonson&rsquo;s Comedies
of Humours are mere personifications of exaggerated
individual traits. They are caricatures rather than
characters. Dickens frequently commits the error of
exhibiting figures devoid of representative traits. Tommy
Traddles is sharply individualized by the fact that his
hair is always standing on end; but he exhibits no essential
truth of human nature. Barkis, who is always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
willin&rsquo;, and Micawber, who is always waiting for something
to turn up, are emphatically distinguished from
everybody else in or out of fiction; but they lack the large
reality of representative characters. They are individualities
instead of individuals. They do not exhibit
an agglomeration of many different but consistent traits
rendered unified and single by a dominant and informing
characteristic, such as ambition in Macbeth, senility
in Lear, or irresoluteness in Hamlet. A great fictitious
character must be at once generic and specific; it must
give concrete expression to an abstract idea; it must be
an individualized representation of the typical qualities
of a class. It is only figures of this sort that are finally
worth while in fiction,&ndash;&ndash;more worth the reader&rsquo;s while
than the average actual man.</p>
<p><b>Static and Kinetic Characters.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But there is yet another
reason why it is often more valuable for the reader
to meet fictitious characters than to meet people of the
same class in actual life; and this reason is that during
the day or two it takes to read a novel he may review
the most significant events of many years, and thus get
to know a fictitious character more completely in a brief
space of time than he could get to know him, if the character
were actual, in several years of continuous acquaintanceship.
We meet two sorts of characters in
the pages of the novelists,&ndash;&ndash;characters which may be
called static, and characters which may be called kinetic.
The first remain unchanged throughout the course
of the story: the second grow up or down, as the case
may be, through the influence of circumstances, of their
own wills, or of the wills of other people. The recurrent
characters of Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s early tales, such as Mrs.
Hauksbee, Strickland, Mulvaney, Ortheris, and Learoyd,
are static figures. Although they do different
things in different stories, their characters remain always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the same. But Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are
kinetic figures; they grow and change throughout the
novel; they are, each in his own way, bigger and wiser
people when we leave them than they were when first
we met them. To show a character developing under
stress or ripening easily beneath beneficent influences is
one of the greatest possibilities of fiction. And to exhibit
the gradual disintegration of a character, as George Eliot
does in the case of Tito Melema, is to teach us more of
the tragedy of life than we might learn in many years of
actual experience.</p>
<p><b>Direct and Indirect Delineation.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Only after the
process of creation is completed, and a character stands
living in the mind of the novelist, need he consider the
various technical expedients which may be employed to
make the reader conscious of the character as a personal
presence. These technical expedients are many; but
they may all be grouped as phases of one or the other of
two contrasted methods of delineating character, which
may be called, for convenience, direct and indirect.
According to the first method, traits of character are
conveyed directly to the reader through some sort of
statement by the writer of the story: according to the
second method, characteristics are conveyed indirectly
to the reader through a necessary inference, on his part,
from the narrative itself. In employing the first, or
direct, method, the author (either in his own person or in
that of some character which he assumes) stands between
the reader and the character he is portraying, in the attitude,
more or less frankly confessed, of showman or
expositor. In employing the second, or indirect, method,
the author seeks to obliterate himself as much as possible
from the reader&rsquo;s consciousness; and having brought the
reader face to face with the character he desires to portray,
leaves the reader to make his own acquaintance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
with the character. The indirect method is of course
more difficult, and, when successfully employed, is more
artistic, than the direct method. But seldom is either
used to the exclusion of the other; and it would be possible
to illustrate by successive quotations from any first-rate
novel, like &ldquo;The Egoist&rdquo; for example, how the same
characteristics are portrayed first by the one and then by
the other method.</p>
<p><b>Subdivisions of Both Methods.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Each of the two
methods shows itself in many different phases. There
are several distinct ways of delineating character directly,
and also several distinct means of indirect delineation.
It is perhaps serviceable for the purposes of study
to distinguish them somewhat sharply one from another;
but it must always be remembered that the masters of
fiction usually employ a commingling of them all, without
conscious awareness of any critical distinction between
them. Bearing this ever in mind, let us venture on a
critical examination of some of the most frequently
recurrent phases, first, of the direct, and secondly, of
the indirect, method.</p>
<p><b>I. Direct Delineation: 1. By Exposition.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The most
obvious, and at the same time the most elementary,
means of direct portrayal is by a deliberate expository
statement of the leading traits of the character to be
portrayed. Thus, at the outset of &ldquo;The Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo;
the author, writing in the person of the Vicar, thus
expounds the traits of Mrs. Primrose:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was ever of opinion, that the honest man who married
and brought up a large family, did more service than
he who continued single, and only talked of population.
From this motive, I had scarce taken orders a year before
I began to think seriously of matrimony, and chose my
wife as she did her wedding-gown, not for a fine glossy
surface, but such qualities as would wear well. To do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
her justice, she was a good-natured notable woman; and
as for breeding, there were few country ladies who could
show more. She could read any English book without
much spelling; but for pickling, preserving, and cookery,
none could excel her. She prided herself also upon
being an excellent contriver in housekeeping; though I
could never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This elementary means of portrayal has the obvious
advantage of succinctness. The reader is told at once,
and with a fair measure of completeness, what he is to
think about the character in question. For this reason
the expedient is highly serviceable at the outset of a
story. So excellent an artist as Stevenson, in the &ldquo;New
Arabian Nights,&rdquo; began each tale in the collection with a
paragraph in which he expounded the main traits of the
leading character. But the expedient has also several
disadvantages. In the first place, being expository, it is
not narrative in mood; it savors of the essay rather than
the story; and if it be used not at the outset but during
the course of a narrative, it halts the progress of the action.
In the second place, it is abstract rather than
concrete; it does not bring the reader into the presence of
a character, but merely into the presence of an explanation;
and it leaves the reader in an attitude exactly like
that which he holds toward certain actual people, concerning
whom he has been told a great deal by their
friends, but whom he has never met himself. The whole
first chapter of &ldquo;The Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; is a series of
little essays on the various members of the Primrose
family. Nothing happens in the chapter; the characters
never step bodily into view; and we feel at the end that
we have heard a great deal of talk about people whom we
should like to meet but whom as yet we have not seen.</p>
<p><b>2. By Description.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is therefore in certain ways
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
more satisfactory to portray character directly through a
descriptive, rather than an expository, statement. Thus,
in the second chapter of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; we are
told of Mr. Pecksniff:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His very throat was moral. You saw a good deal
of it. You looked over a very low fence of white cravat
(whereof no man had ever beheld the tie, for he fastened
it behind), and there it lay, a valley between two jutting
heights of collar, serene and whiskerless before you. It
seemed to say, on the part of Mr. Pecksniff, &lsquo;There is no
deception, ladies and gentlemen, all is peace, a holy calm
pervades me.&rsquo; So did his hair, just grizzled with an
iron-gray, which was all brushed off his forehead, and
stood bolt upright, or slightly drooped in kindred action
with his heavy eyelids. So did his person, which was
sleek though free from corpulency. So did his manner,
which was soft and oily. In a word, even his plain black
suit, and state of widower, and dangling double eye-glass,
all tended to the same purpose, and cried aloud, &lsquo;Behold
the moral Pecksniff!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement, being in the main concretely descriptive
rather than abstractly expository, brings us face to
face with the character at the same time that it tells us
what to think of him. And whereas we feel that we have
merely heard about Mrs. Primrose, we feel that we have
really seen Mr. Pecksniff.</p>
<p><b>[Gradual Portrayal.]</b>&ndash;&ndash;It was the custom of Sir Walter
Scott, at the introduction of a character, to furnish the
reader with an elaborate set portrayal, partly expository
and partly descriptive, of the traits and features of the
character; and to allow this initial direct statement to do
duty through the remainder of the novel. The trouble
with this off-hand expedient is that the reader inevitably
forgets the set statement of the author before the narrative
has very far progressed. It is therefore more effective
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
to make a direct portrayal of character, whether
expository or descriptive, little by little rather than all
in a lump; and to present at any one time to the reader
only such traits or features as he needs to be reminded
of in order to appreciate the scene before him. Thus, in
Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s masterpiece, called &ldquo;They,&rdquo; we catch this
initial glimpse of Miss Florence:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The garden door&ndash;&ndash;heavy oak sunk deep in the thickness
of the wall&ndash;&ndash;opened further: a woman in a big
garden hat set her foot slowly on the time-hollowed stone
step and as slowly walked across the turf. I was forming
some apology when she lifted up her head and I saw that
she was blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I heard you,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a motor car?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it is only after five pages of narrative that the
writer deems it the proper time to add:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She stood looking at me with open blue eyes in which
no sight lay, and I saw for the first time that she was
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>3. By Psychological Analysis.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The point that a direct
statement of characteristics should preferably be delivered
to the reader little by little rather than all in a
lump is particularly patent when the statement is not
external and objective like those already quoted, but
internal and subjective. In a certain type of fiction,
which is commonly called &ldquo;the psychological novel,&rdquo;
the usual expedient for delineating character is a statement
partly narrative and partly expository of what is
taking place within the mind of the fictitious person,
based upon an analysis of his thoughts and his emotions,
at important moments of the story. This expedient
of portraying character by mental analysis is George
Eliot&rsquo;s favorite technical device. Here is a typical
passage, from &ldquo;The Mill on the Floss,&rdquo; Chapter V:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
and it must be tea-time, and they were all having their
tea, and not thinking of her. Well, then, she would stay
up there and starve herself&ndash;&ndash;hide herself behind the tub,
and stay there all night; and then they would all be
frightened, and Tom would be sorry. Thus Maggie
thought in the pride of her heart, as she crept behind the
tub; but presently she began to cry again at the idea that
they didn&rsquo;t mind her being there. If she went down
again to Tom now&ndash;&ndash;would he forgive her?&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
her father would be there, and he would take her part.
But then she wanted Tom to forgive her because he
loved her, not because his father told him. No, she
would never go down if Tom didn&rsquo;t come to fetch her.
This resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark
minutes behind the tub; but then the need of being
loved, the strongest need in poor Maggie&rsquo;s nature, began
to wrestle with her pride, and soon threw it. She crept
from behind her tub into the twilight of the long attic,
but just then she heard a quick footstep on the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom had been too much interested in his talk with
Luke, in going the round of the premises, walking in and
out where he pleased, and whittling sticks without any
particular reason, except that he didn&rsquo;t whittle sticks at
school, to think of Maggie, and the effect his anger had
produced on her. He meant to punish her, and that
business having been performed, he occupied himself
with other matters, like a practical person.&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And so on. It is only after four hundred words more
of this sort of analysis that the author tells us: &ldquo;It
was Tom&rsquo;s step, then, that Maggie heard on the stairs.&rdquo;
This is George Eliot&rsquo;s way of portraying the characters
of two children who have quarreled.</p>
<p>Much is to be said in favor of this expedient of depicting
character by analysis. It is the only means by which
the reader may be informed directly of those thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and emotions of a character which are the mainsprings
of his acts. And since we cannot feel that we know a
person intimately unless we understand the workings of
his mind at characteristic moments, we derive a great
advantage from this immediate presentation of his mental
processes. On the other hand, the use of the expedient
destroys the very desirable illusion that the reader is an
observer actually looking at the action, since the details
depicted do not happen to the eye but rather to the analytic
understanding. The expedient has the disadvantages
of being exceedingly abstract, and of halting happenings
while the author tells us why they happened.
It is certainly unfortunate, for instance, that it should
take Tom a whole long page to get to Maggie after she
has heard his &ldquo;<i>quick</i> footstep on the stairs.&rdquo; Furthermore,
this expedient tends to destroy the illusion of
reality by forcing the reader into a mental attitude which
he seldom assumes in looking on at actual life. During
actual occurrences people almost never pause to analyze
each other and seldom even analyze themselves. They
act, and watch other people act, without a microscopic
insight into motives. And surely the purpose of narrative
should be to represent events as they seem to occur
in actuality, rather than to present a dissertation on their
causes in the manner of an essay.</p>
<p>An important point, however, remains to be considered.
Events are of two kinds, external and internal; things
happen subjectively as well as objectively: and in representing
the sort of occurrence which takes place only
inside a person&rsquo;s mind, the expedient of analysis is by far
the most serviceable means of making clear the elements
of character that contribute to it. But if the same expedient
be employed habitually in the depiction of external
events as well, it is likely to give the impression of
unwarrantable vivisection. There is a certain falsity of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
mood in giving an objective event a subjective rendering.</p>
<p><b>4. By Reports from Other Characters.</b>&ndash;&ndash;When, therefore,
it is desired to depict a character by direct comment
on his actions or his personality, there is a great advantage
in allowing the comment to be made by one of the
other characters in the story, instead of by the author
himself in an attitude of assumed omniscience. Jane
Austen deftly exhibits this subtler phase of the expedient
in many admirable passages. For instance, in Chapter
XXXIII of &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; Mrs. Elton thus chatters to Emma
Woodhouse:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.
I quite rave about Jane Fairfax&ndash;&ndash;a sweet, interesting
creature. So mild and lady-like&ndash;&ndash;and with
such talents! I assure you I think she has very extraordinary
talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays
extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly
on that point. Oh! she is absolutely charming!
You will laugh at my warmth&ndash;&ndash;but upon my word, I
talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Chapter XXI the same character has been thus commented
on by Emma Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley.
Emma speaks first:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Fairfax is reserved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I always told you she was&ndash;&ndash;a little; but you will soon
overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be
overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence. What
arises from discretion must be honored.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You think her diffident. I do not see it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These passages not only serve to portray, more or less
directly, the personality of Jane Fairfax, but serve also
at the same time to portray indirectly the personalities
of the people who are talking about her. Mrs. Elton, in
particular, is very clearly exhibited. And this point leads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
us to an examination of one of the most effective means
of indirect delineation.</p>
<p><b>II. Indirect Delineation: 1. By Speech.</b>&ndash;&ndash;If the mere
speech of a fictitious figure be reported with sufficient
fidelity to truth, it is possible to convey through this
expedient alone a very vivid sense of character. Consider
the following bits of talk:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a gun-sharp? I am sorry. I could have
surprised you. Apart from my gun, my tale don&rsquo;t
amount to much of anything. I thank you, but I don&rsquo;t
use any tobacco you&rsquo;d be likely to carry.... Bull
Durham? <i>Bull Durham!</i> I take it all back&ndash;&ndash;every
last word. Bull Durham&ndash;&ndash;here! If ever you strike
Akron, Ohio, when this fool-war&rsquo;s over, remember you&rsquo;ve
Laughton O. Zigler in your vest pocket. Including the
city of Akron. We&rsquo;ve a little club there.... Hell!
What&rsquo;s the sense of talking Akron with no pants?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did I talk? I despise exaggeration&ndash;&ndash;tain&rsquo;t American
or scientific&ndash;&ndash;but as true as I&rsquo;m sitting here like a
blue-ended baboon in a kloof, Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s Western
tour was a maiden&rsquo;s sigh compared to my advertising
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But the general was the peach. I presume you&rsquo;re
acquainted with the average run of British generals, but
this was my first. I sat on his left hand, and he talked
like&ndash;&ndash;like the <i>Ladies&rsquo; Home Journal</i>. J&rsquo;ever read that
paper? It&rsquo;s refined, Sir&ndash;&ndash;and innocuous, and full of
nickel-plated sentiments guaranteed to improve the
mind. He was it. He began by a Lydia Pinkham heart-to-heart
talk about my health, and hoped the boys had
done me well, and that I was enjoying my stay in their
midst.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These passages are taken from Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s story
called &ldquo;The Captive.&rdquo; The action is laid during the
South-African war. Is it necessary to add that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
speaker is an American gun-inventor who has fought upon
the Boer side and has been captured by the British?</p>
<p>One point must be considered carefully. The art of
these passages lies mainly in the fact that we learn more
about Zigler indirectly, from his manner of talking, than
directly, from the things which he tells us of himself.
His statement that he comes from Akron, Ohio, is less
suggestive than his fondness for Bull Durham. Any
direct statement made by a character concerning himself
is of no more artistic value than if it were made about him
by the author, unless his manner of making it gives at the
same time an indirect evidence of his nature.</p>
<p>The subtlest phase of indirect delineation through
speech is a conveyance to the reader, through a character&rsquo;s
remarks about himself, of a sense of him different
from that which his statement literally expresses. Sir
Willoughby Patterne, in &ldquo;The Egoist,&rdquo; talks about himself
frequently and in detail; but the reader soon learns
from the tone and manner of his utterance to discount
the high esteem in which he holds himself. By saying
one thing directly, the egoist conveys another and a different
thing indirectly to the reader.</p>
<p><b>2. By Action.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But in fiction, as in life, actions speak
louder than words: and the most convincing way of delineating
character indirectly is by exhibiting a person
in the performance of a characteristic action. If the
action be visualized with sufficient clearness and if its
dominant details be presented to the reader with adequate
emphasis, a more vivid impression of character
will be conveyed than through any sort of direct statement
by the author. As an instance of characterization
through action only, without comment or direct portrayal,
let us consider the following passage from the duel scene
of &ldquo;The Master of Ballantrae.&rdquo; Two brothers, Mr.
Henry and the Master, hate each other; they fall to altercation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
over a game of cards; and the scene is narrated
by Mackellar, a servant of Mr. Henry&rsquo;s:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry laid down his cards. He rose to his feet
very softly, and seemed all the while like a person in deep
thought. &lsquo;You coward!&rsquo; he said gently, as if to himself.
And then, with neither hurry nor any particular violence,
he struck the Master in the mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Master sprang to his feet like one transfigured; I
had never seen the man so beautiful. &lsquo;A blow!&rsquo; he cried.
&lsquo;I would not take a blow from God Almighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lower your voice,&rsquo; said Mr. Henry. &lsquo;Do you wish
my father to interfere for you again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen.&rsquo; I cried, and sought to come
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Master caught me by the shoulder, held me at
arm&rsquo;s length, and still addressing his brother: &lsquo;Do you
know what this means?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was the most deliberate act of my life,&rsquo; says Mr.
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must have blood, I must have blood for this,&rsquo; says
the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Please God it shall be yours,&rsquo; said Mr. Henry; and
he went to the wall and took down a pair of swords
that hung there with others, naked. These he presented
to the Master by the points. &lsquo;Mackellar shall
see us play fair,&rsquo; said Mr. Henry. &lsquo;I think it very needful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You need insult me no more,&rsquo; said the Master, taking
one of the swords at random. &lsquo;I have hated you all
my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My father is but newly gone to bed,&rsquo; said Mr. Henry.
&lsquo;We must go somewhere forth of the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is an excellent place in the long shrubbery,&rsquo;
said the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;shame upon you both! Sons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
of the same mother, would you turn against the life she
gave you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Even so, Mackellar,&rsquo; said Mr. Henry, with the same
perfect quietude of manner he had shown throughout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not necessary for Mackellar to tell us that, whereas
Mr. Henry is phlegmatic and deliberate, the Master is
impulsive and mercurial. It is not necessary for him to
attempt analysis of the emotions and thoughts of the
leading characters, since these are sufficiently evident
from what they do and say. The action happens to the
eye and ear, without the interpretation of an analytic intellect;
but the reader is made actually present at the
scene, and can see and judge it for himself. The method
is absolutely narrative and not at all expository,&ndash;&ndash;entirely
objective and concrete. Surely this is the most artistic
means of portraying those elements of character which
contribute to external, or objective, events: and even
what happens inside the mind of a character may often
be more poignantly suggested by a concrete account of
how he looks and what he does than by an abstract
analytic statement of the movements of his mind. When
Hepzibah Pyncheon opens her shop in the House of the
Seven Gables, her state of feeling is indicated indirectly,
by what she does and how she does it.</p>
<p><b>3. By Effect on Other Characters.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Perhaps the most
delicate means of indirect delineation is to suggest the
personality of one character by exhibiting his effect upon
certain other people in the story. In the third book of
the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; there is a temporary truce upon the plains of
Troy; and certain elders of the city look forth from the
tower of the Sc&aelig;an gates and meditate upon the ten long
years of conflict and of carnage during which so many of
their sons have died. Toward them walks the white-armed
Helen, robed and veiled in white; and when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
mark her approach, they say to each other (old and wise
and weary with sorrows though they be):&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;&lsquo;Small blame is theirs, if both the Trojan knights<br />
And brazen-mailed Achaians have endured<br />
So long so many evils for the sake<br />
Of that one woman.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ndash;&ndash;(Bryant&rsquo;s Version.)</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable instance in modern literature
of the use of this expedient is Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s tale of
&ldquo;Mrs. Bathurst.&rdquo; The story is all about the woman
from whom it takes its title; but she never for a moment
appears upon the scene of action, and is portrayed entirely
through her effect upon several different men.
Here is a bit of conversation concerning her. Note her
effect upon the humorous and not especially sensitive
Pyecroft.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said Pyecroft suddenly:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many women have you been intimate with all
over the world, Pritch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pritchard blushed plum color to the short hairs of his
seventeen-inch neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Undreds,&rsquo; said Pyecroft. &lsquo;So&rsquo;ve I. How many of
&rsquo;em can you remember in your own mind, settin&rsquo; aside
the first&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; per&rsquo;aps the last&ndash;&ndash;<i>and one more</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Few, wonderful few, now I tax myself,&rsquo; said Sergeant
Pritchard, relievedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; how many times might you &rsquo;ave been at Aukland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One&ndash;&ndash;two,&rsquo; he began. &lsquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t make it more
than three times in ten years. But I can remember
every time that I ever saw Mrs. B.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So can I&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve only been to Aukland twice&ndash;&ndash;how
she stood an&rsquo; what she was sayin&rsquo; an&rsquo; what she
looked like. That&rsquo;s the secret. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t beauty, so to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
speak, nor good talk necessarily. It&rsquo;s just It. Some
women&rsquo;ll stay in a man&rsquo;s memory if they once walked
down a street, but most of &rsquo;em you can live with a month
on end, an&rsquo; next commission you&rsquo;d be put to it to certify
whether they talked in their sleep or not, as one might
say.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>4. By Environment.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Another very delicate expedient
is to suggest a character through a careful presentation
of his habitual environment. We learn a great deal
about Roderick Usher from the melancholy aspect of his
House. It is possible to describe a living-room in such
a way as to convey a very definite sense of its occupant
before he enters it. Notice, for example, how much we
learn about Mr. and Mrs. Boffin (especially the latter)
from this descriptive passage of Chapter V of &ldquo;Our
Mutual Friend.&rdquo; Silas Wegg has come to fulfill his engagement
to read aloud to them the &ldquo;Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire:&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the queerest of rooms, fitted and furnished more
like a luxurious amateur tap-room than anything else
within the ken of Silas Wegg. There were two wooden
settles by the fire, one on either side of it, with a corresponding
table before each. On one of these tables the
eight volumes were ranged flat, in a row like a galvanic
battery; on the other, certain squat case-bottles of inviting
appearance seemed to stand on tiptoe to exchange
glances with Mr. Wegg over a front row of tumblers and
a basin of white sugar. On the hob, a kettle steamed; on,
the hearth, a cat reposed. Facing the fire between the
settles, a sofa, a footstool, and a little table formed a
centrepiece devoted to Mrs. Boffin. They were garish
in taste and color, but were expensive articles of drawing-room
furniture that had a very odd look beside the
settles and the flaring gaslight pendant from the ceiling.
There was a flowery carpet on the floor; but, instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
reaching to the fireside, its glowing vegetation stopped
short at Mrs. Boffin&rsquo;s footstool, and gave place to a
region of sand and sawdust. Mr. Wegg also noticed,
with admiring eyes, that, while the flowery land displayed
such hollow ornamentation as stuffed birds, and waxen
fruits under glass shades, there were, in the territory
where vegetation ceased, compensatory shelves on which
the best part of a large pie and likewise of a cold joint were
plainly discernible among other solids. The room itself
was large, though low; and the heavy frames of its old-fashioned
windows, and the heavy beams in its crooked
ceiling, seemed to indicate that it had once been a house
of some mark standing alone in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Boffin nor Mrs. Boffin appears in this descriptive
paragraph; yet many of the idiosyncrasies of each are
suggested by the conglomeration of queer belongings that
they have gathered round them.</p>
<p>The student of the art of fiction may find profitable
exercise in practising separately the various means of
portraying character which have been illustrated in this
chapter; but, as was stated at the outset, he should always
remember that these means are seldom used by the
great artists singly, but are generally employed to complement
each other in contributing to a central impression.
The character of Becky Sharp, for instance, is
delineated indirectly through her speech, her actions, her
environment, and her effect on other people, and at the
same time is delineated directly through comments
made upon her by the author and by other figures in
the story, through analysis of her thoughts and her
emotions, through expository statements of her traits,
and through occasional descriptions of her. In all of
these ways does Thackeray exert himself to give the
world assurance of a woman.</p>
<p>It would, however, be extremely difficult to imagine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
Becky Sharp divorced from her environment of London
high society. She is a part of her setting, and her setting
is a part of her. We have just noticed, in the case of
that queer room of the Boffins&rsquo;, how the mere representation
of setting may contribute to the delineation of character.
But setting is important in many other ways;
and it is to a special consideration of that element of narrative
that we must next turn our attention.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Evolution of Background in the History of Painting:
The First Stage.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In the history of figure painting it is
interesting to study the evolution of the element of background.
This element is non-existent in the earliest
examples of pictorial art. The figures in Pompeiian
frescoes are limned upon a blank bright wall, most frequently
deep red in color. The father of Italian painting,
Cimabue, following the custom of the Byzantine
mosa&iuml;cists, whose work he had doubtless studied at Ravenna,
drew his figures against a background devoid of distance
and perspective and detail; and even in the work
of his greater and more natural pupil, Giotto, the element
of background remains comparatively insignificant.
What interests us in Giotto&rsquo;s work at Padua and Assisi
is first of all the story that he has to tell, and secondly
the human quality of the characters that he exhibits.
His sense of setting is extremely slight; and the homely
details that he presents for the purpose of suggesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the time and place and circumstances of his action are
very crudely depicted. His frescoes are all foreground.
It is the figures in the forefront of his pictures that arrest
our eye. His buildings and his landscapes are conventionalized
out of any real reference to his people. These
are examples of the first stage of evolution&ndash;&ndash;the stage in
which the element of background bears no significant
relation to the main business of the picture.</p>
<p><b>The Second Stage.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In the second stage, the background
is brought into an artistic, or decorative, relation
with the figures in the foreground. This phase is
exhibited by Italian painting at its period of maturity.
The great Florentines drew their figures against a background
of decorative line, the great Venetians against a
background of decorative color. But even in the work
of the greatest of them the background exists usually
to fulfil a purpose merely decorative, a purpose with
immediate reference to art but without immediate reference
to life. There is no real reason, with reference to
life itself, why the &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; of Leonardo should smile
inscrutably upon us before a background of jagged rocks
and cloudy sky; and the curtains in Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sistine
Madonna&rdquo; are introduced merely as a detail of composition,
and are not intended as a literal statement that curtains
hung upon a rod exist in heaven.</p>
<p><b>The Third Stage.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In the third stage, which is exhibited
by later painting, the background is brought into
living relation with the figures of the foreground,&ndash;&ndash;a relation
suggested not merely by the exigencies of art but
rather by the conditions of life itself. Thus the great
Dutch <i>genre</i> painters, like the younger Teniers, show their
characters in immediate human relation to a carefully
detailed interior; or if, like Adrian van Ostade, they take
them out of doors, it is to show them entirely at home in
an accustomed landscape.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>This stage, in its modern development, exhibits an
absolutely essential relation between the foreground
and the background&ndash;&ndash;the figures and the setting&ndash;&ndash;so
that neither could be imagined exactly as it is without the
presence of the other. Such an essential harmony is
shown in the &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; of Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet. The
people exist for the sake of giving meaning to the landscape;
and the landscape exists for the sake of giving
meaning to the people. The &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; is neither
figure painting nor landscape painting merely; it is
both.</p>
<p><b>Similar Evolution of Setting in the History of Fiction:
The First Stage.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In the history of fiction we may note
a similar evolution in the element of setting. The earliest
folk-tales of every nation happen &ldquo;once upon a time,&rdquo;
and without any definite localization. In the &ldquo;Gesta
Romanorum,&rdquo; that medieval repository of accumulated
narratives, the element of setting is nearly as non-existent
as the element of background in the frescoes of Pompeii.
Even in the &ldquo;Decameron&rdquo; of Boccaccio the stories are
seldom localized: they happen almost anywhere at almost
any time. The interest in Boccaccio&rsquo;s narrative, like
the interest in Giotto&rsquo;s painting, is centred first of all in
the element of action, and secondly in the element of
character. But his stories are all foreground. When the
scene is out of doors, it is set vaguely in a conventional
landscape: when it is indoors, it is set vaguely in a conventional
palace. Because of this, his narrative is
lacking in visual appeal. Most of his <i>novelle</i> read like
summaries of novels,&ndash;&ndash;setting forth an abstract synopsis
of the action rather than a concrete representation of it.
He <i>tells</i> you what happens, instead of <i>making</i> it happen
before the eye of your imagination. His characters are
drawn in outline merely, instead of being livingly projected
in relation to a definite environment. The defect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of his narrative, like the defect of Giotto&rsquo;s painting, is
mainly lack of background.</p>
<p><b>The Second Stage.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Somewhat later in the history of
fiction, as in the history of figure painting, we find instances
in which the element of setting is used for a decorative
purpose, and is brought into an artistic relation
with the elements of action and character. Such a use
is made of landscape, for example, in the &ldquo;Orlando
Furioso&rdquo; of Ariosto and the &ldquo;Faerie Queene&rdquo; of Spenser.
The settings depicted by these narrative poets are essentially
pictorial, and are used as a decorative background
to the action rather than as part and parcel of it. If we
seek an example in prose rather than in poetry, we need
only turn to the &ldquo;Arcadia&rdquo; of Sir Philip Sidney. In
this again the setting is beautifully fashioned, but is employed
merely for a decorative purpose. The background
of pastoral landscape bears no necessary relation
to the figures in the foreground. It exists for the sake
of art rather than for the sake of life. This employment
of the element of setting for a purpose essentially pictorial
subsists in many later works of fiction, like the
&ldquo;Paul and Virginia&rdquo; of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. In
this the setting is composed and painted for the sake of its
own sentimental beauty, and is obtruded even at the
expense of the more vital elements of character and
action. The story is, as it were, merely a motive for
decorative composition.</p>
<p><b>The Third Stage: 1. Setting as an Aid to Action.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It
is only in fiction of a more modern spirit that the element
of setting has been brought into living relation with
the action and the characters; and it is only in the last
century that the most intimate possibilities of such a
relation have been appreciated and applied. Of course
the most elementary means of making the setting &ldquo;part
and parcel of the business of the story&rdquo; is to employ it as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
a utilitarian adjunct to the action. Granted certain
incidents that are to happen, certain scenery and properties
are useful, in the novel just as in the theatre; and if
these are supplied advisedly, the setting will, as it were,
become a part of what is happening instead of remaining
merely a decorative background to the incidents. The
first English author to establish firmly this utilitarian
relation between the setting and the action was Daniel
Defoe. Defoe was by profession a journalist; and the
most characteristic quality of his mind was an habitual
matter-of-factness. Plausibility was what he most desired
in his fictions; and he discerned instinctively that
the readiest means of making a story plausible was by
representing with entire concreteness and great wealth
of specific detail the physical adjuncts to the action.
The multitudinous particulars of Crusoe&rsquo;s island are
therefore exhibited concretely to the reader one by one,
as Crusoe makes use of them successively in what he does.</p>
<p><b>2. Setting as an Aid to Characterization.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But though
in Defoe the element of setting is merged with the element
of action, it is not brought into intimate relation
with the element of character. The island is a part of
what Crusoe does, rather than a part of what he is.
But the dwelling-room of the Boffins, which was described
in the paragraph from &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; quoted
toward the end of the preceding chapter, is a part of what
the Boffins are, rather than of what they do. The setting
in the latter case is used as an adjunct to the element of
character instead of to the element of action. Fielding
and his contemporaries were the first English novelists
to make the setting in this way representative of personality
as well as useful to the plot; but the finer possibilities
of the relation between setting and character were
not fully realized until the nineteenth century. The
eighteenth-century authors, in so far as they elaborated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
the element of setting, seem to have done so mainly
for the sake of greater vividness. The appeal of setting
being visual, the element was employed to illustrate the
action and to make the characters clearly evident to the
eye. By rendering a story more concrete, a definite
setting rendered it more credible. This the eighteenth-century
novelists discerned; but only with the rise of the
romantic movement was the element applied to subtler
uses.</p>
<p><b>Emotional Harmony in Setting.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A new and very interesting
attitude toward landscape setting was disclosed
by Rousseau in the &ldquo;Nouvelle H&eacute;loise&rdquo; and developed by
his numerous followers in early nineteenth-century romance.
The writers who advocated a &ldquo;return to nature&rdquo;
spelled nature with a capital N and considered it usually
as an anthropomorphic presence. As a result of this,
when they developed a natural background for their
stories, they established a sympathetic interchange of
mood between the characters and the landscape, and imagined
(to use the famous phrase of Leibnitz) a &ldquo;pre-established
harmony&rdquo; between the shifting moods of
nature and of man. Thus the setting was employed no
longer merely to subserve the needs of action or to give
a greater vividness of visual appeal, but was used rather
to symbolize and represent the human emotions evoked
in the characters at significant moments of the plot.
When the hero was suffering with sadness, the sky was
hung with heavy clouds; and when his mind grew illumined
with a glimmering of hope, the sun broke through a
cloud-rift, casting light over the land.</p>
<p>Dickens is especially fond of imagining an emotional
harmony between his settings and his incidents. Consider
for a moment the following well-known passage
from the funeral of Little Nell (&ldquo;The Old Curiosity
Shop,&rdquo; Chapter LXXII):&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Along the crowded path they bore her now; pure as
the newly-fallen snow that covered it; whose day on earth
had been as fleeting. Under the porch, where she had
sat when Heaven in its mercy brought her to that peaceful
spot, she passed again; and the old church received her
in its quiet shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They carried her to one old nook, where she had
many and many a time sat musing, and laid their burden
softly on the pavement. The light streamed on it through
the coloured window&ndash;&ndash;a window where the boughs of
trees were ever rustling in the summer, and where the
birds sang sweetly all day long. With every breath of air
that stirred among those branches in the sunshine, some
trembling, changing light would fall upon her grave....</p>
<p>&ldquo;They saw the vault covered, and the stone fixed
down. Then, when the dusk of evening had come on,
and not a sound disturbed the sacred stillness of the place&ndash;&ndash;when
the bright moon poured in her light on tomb and
monument, on pillar, wall, and arch, and most of all (it
seemed to them) upon her quiet grave&ndash;&ndash;in that calm
time, when outward things and inward thoughts teem
with assurances of immortality, and worldly hopes and
fears are humbled in the dust before them&ndash;&ndash;then, with
tranquil and submissive hearts, they turned away, and
left the child to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the mood of the scene is expressed almost entirely
through the element of setting; and the human emotion
of the mourners is realized and represented by the aspect
of the churchyard.</p>
<p><b>The Pathetic Fallacy.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The excessive use of this expedient
is deplored by John Ruskin in a chapter of &ldquo;Modern
Painters&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;The Pathetic Fallacy.&rdquo; His
point is that, since concrete objects do not actually experience
human emotions, it is a violation of artistic truth
to ascribe such emotions to them. But, on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
hand, it is indubitably true that human beings habitually
translate their own abstract feelings into the concrete
terms of their surroundings; and therefore, in a subjective
sense at least, an emotional harmony frequently does exist
between the mood of a man and the aspect of his environment.
The same place may at the same time look
gloomy to a melancholy man and cheerful to a merry
one; and there is therefore a certain human fitness in
describing it as gloomy or as cheerful, according to the
feeling of the character observing it. Doubtless to a man
tremendously bereaved the very rain may seem a weeping
of high heaven; and surely there are times when it is
deeply true, subjectively, to say that the morning stars
all sing together. What we may call emotional similarity
of setting is therefore not necessarily a fallacy. Even
when it subverts the actual, as in the fable of the morning
stars, it may yet be representative of reality. In its
commoner and less exaggerative phases it is very useful
for purposes of suggestion; and only when it becomes
blatant through abuse may it be said to belie the laws of
life.</p>
<p><b>Emotional Contrast in Setting.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Frequently, however,
emotional similarity between the setting and the characters
is less serviceable, for the sake of emphasis, than
emotional contrast. In the following passage from Mr.
Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Without Benefit of Clergy,&rdquo; the serene and
perfect happiness of Holden and Ameera is emphasized
by contrast with the night-aspect of the plague-infested
city:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My lord and my love, let there be no more foolish
talk of going away. Where thou art, I am. It is
enough.&rsquo; She put an arm round his neck and a hand on
his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many happinesses so complete as those
that are snatched under the shadow of the sword. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
sat together and laughed, calling each other openly by
every pet name that could move the wrath of the gods.
The city below them was locked up in its own torments.
Sulphur fires blazed in the streets; the conches in the
Hindu temples screamed and bellowed, for the gods were
inattentive in those days. There was a service in the
great Mahomedan shrine, and the call to prayer from the
minarets was almost unceasing. They heard the wailing
in the houses of the dead, and once the shriek of a mother
who had lost a child and was calling for its return. In
the gray dawn they saw the dead borne out through the
city gates, each litter with its own little knot of mourners.
Wherefore they kissed each other and shivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Irony in Setting.</b>&ndash;&ndash;An emotional contrast of this nature
between the mood of the characters and the mood
of the setting may be pushed to the point of irony. In a
story by Alphonse Daudet, entitled &ldquo;The Elixir of the
Reverend Father Gaucher,&rdquo; a certain monastery is
saved from financial ruin by the sale of a cordial which
Father Gaucher has invented and distilled. But the
necessity of sampling the cordial frequently during the
process of manufacturing it leads the reverend father
eventually to become an habitual drunkard. And
toward the end of the story an ironic contrast is drawn
between the solemn monastery, murmurous with chants
and prayers, and Father Gaucher in his distillery hilariously
singing a ribald drinking-song.</p>
<p><b>Artistic and Philosophical Employment.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The uses of
setting that have been thus far considered have been
artistic rather than philosophical in nature; but very recent
writers have grown to use the element not only for
the sake of illustrating character and action but also
for the sake of determining them. The sociologists of
the nineteenth century have come to regard circumstance
as a prime motive for action, and environment as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
prime influence on character; and recent writers have applied
this philosophic thesis in their employment of the
element of setting.</p>
<p><b>1. Setting as a Motive Toward Action.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The way in
which the setting may suggest the action is thus discoursed
upon by Stevenson in his &ldquo;Gossip on Romance&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drama is the poetry of conduct, romance the poetry
of circumstance. The pleasure that we take in life is of
two sorts&ndash;&ndash;the active and the passive. Now we are conscious
of a great command over our destiny; anon we are
lifted up by circumstance, as by a breaking wave, and
dashed we know not how into the future. Now we are
pleased by our conduct, anon merely pleased by our
surroundings. It would be hard to say which of these
modes of satisfaction is the more effective, but the latter
is surely the more constant....</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing in life calls for another; there is a fitness in
events and places. The sight of a pleasant arbour puts
it in our mind to sit there. One place suggests work,
another idleness, a third early rising and long rambles
in the dew. The effect of night, of any flowing water,
of lighted cities, of the peep of day, of ships, of the open
ocean, calls up in the mind an army of anonymous desires
and pleasures. Something, we feel, should happen; we
know not what, yet we proceed in quest of it. And many
of the happiest hours of life fleet by us in this vain attendance
on the genius of the place and moment. It is thus
that tracts of young fir, and low rocks that reach into
deep soundings, particularly torture and delight me.
Something must have happened in such places, and perhaps
ages back, to members of my race; and when I was
a child I tried in vain to invent appropriate games for
them, as I still try, just as vainly, to fit them with the
proper story. Some places speak distinctly. Certain
dank gardens cry aloud for a murder; certain old houses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
demand to be haunted; certain coasts are set apart for
shipwreck. Other spots again seem to abide their destiny,
suggestive and impenetrable, &lsquo;miching mallecho.&rsquo;
The inn at Burford Bridge, with its arbours and green
garden and silent, eddying river&ndash;&ndash;though it is known already
as the place where Keats wrote some of his &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo;
and Nelson parted from his Emma&ndash;&ndash;still seems to
wait the coming of the appropriate legend. Within
these ivied walls, behind these old green shutters, some
further business smoulders, waiting for its hour. The old
Hawes Inn at the Queen&rsquo;s Ferry makes a similar call
upon my fancy. There it stands, apart from the town,
beside the pier, in a climate of its own, half inland, half
marine&ndash;&ndash;in front, the ferry bubbling with the tide and
the guardship swinging to her anchor; behind, the old
garden with the trees. Americans seek it already for the
sake of Lovel and Oldbuck, who dined there at the beginning
of the &ldquo;Antiquary.&rdquo; But you need not tell me&ndash;&ndash;that
is not all; there is some story, unrecorded or not yet complete,
which must express the meaning of that inn more
fully.... I have lived both at the Hawes and
Burford in a perpetual flutter, on the heels, as it seemed,
of some adventure that should justify the place; but
though the feeling had me to bed at night and called me
again at morning in one unbroken round of pleasure and
suspense, nothing befell me in either worth remark. The
man or the hour had not yet come; but some day, I think,
a boat shall put off from the Queen&rsquo;s Ferry, fraught with
a dear cargo, and some frosty night a horseman, on a
tragic errand, rattle with his whip upon the green shutters
of the inn at Burford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way, the setting may, in many cases, exist as the
initial element of the narrative, and suggest an action
appropriate to itself. But it may do more than that. In
certain special instances the setting may not only suggest,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
but may even cause, the action, and remain the deciding
factor in determining its course. This is the case, for
example, in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s story, &ldquo;At the End of the
Passage,&rdquo; which opens thus:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four men, each entitled to &lsquo;life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness,&rsquo; sat at a table playing whist. The thermometer
marked&ndash;&ndash;for them&ndash;&ndash;one hundred and one
degrees of heat. The room was darkened till it was only
just possible to distinguish the pips of the cards and the
very white faces of the players. A tattered, rotten
punkah of whitewashed calico was puddling the hot air
and whining dolefully at each stroke. Outside lay gloom
of a November day in London. There was neither sky,
sun, nor horizon&ndash;&ndash;nothing but a brown purple haze of
heat. It was as though the earth were dying of apoplexy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From time to time clouds of tawny dust rose from the
ground without wind or warning, flung themselves tablecloth-wise
among the tops of the parched trees, and came
down again. Then a whirling dust-devil would scutter
across the plain for a couple of miles, break, and fall
outward, though there was nothing to check its flight
save a long low line of piled railway-sleepers white with
the dust, a cluster of huts made of mud, condemned rails,
and canvas, and the one squat four-roomed bungalow
that belonged to the assistant engineer in charge of a
section of the Gaudhari State Line then under construction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrible tale that follows could happen only as a
result of the fearful loneliness and, more especially, the
maddening heat of such a place as is described in these
opening paragraphs. The setting in this story causes
and determines the action.</p>
<p><b>2. Setting as an Influence on Character.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But in
many other tales by recent writers the setting is used not
so much to determine the action as to influence and mold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
the characters; and when employed for this purpose, it
becomes expressive of one of the most momentous truths
of human life. For what a man <i>is</i> at any period of his
existence is largely the result of the interaction of two
forces,&ndash;&ndash;namely, the innate tendencies of his nature and
the shaping power of his environment. George Meredith,
and more especially Mr. Thomas Hardy, therefore
devote a great deal of attention to setting as an influence
on character. Consider, for example, the following brief
passage from Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tess of the D&rsquo;Ubervilles&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of Froom
Vale, at a season when the rush of juices could almost be
heard below the hiss of fertilization, it was impossible
that the most fanciful love should not grow passionate.
The ready hearts existing there were impregnated by
their surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zola, in his essay on &ldquo;The Experimental Novel,&rdquo; states
that the proper function of setting is to exhibit &ldquo;the
environment which determines and completes the man&rdquo;;
and the philosophic study of environment reacting upon
character is one of the main features of his own monumental
series of novels devoted to the Rougon-Macquart
family. His example has been followed by a host of recent
writers; and a new school of fiction has grown up, the
main purpose of which is to exhibit the influence of certain
carefully studied social, natural, business, or professional
conditions on the sort of people who live and work
among them.</p>
<p>This incentive has been developed to manifest advantage
in America by such novelists as Mrs. Mary E.
Wilkins Freeman, Mr. George W. Cable, Mr. Hamlin
Garland, Mrs. Edith Wharton, Frank Norris, Jack London,
Mr. Booth Tarkington, and Mr. Stewart Edward
White. Each of these authors&ndash;&ndash;and many others might
be mentioned&ndash;&ndash;has attained a special sort of eminence by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
studying minutely the effect upon impressionable characters
of a particular environment. The manifold diversity
of life in the many different districts of the United
States affords our fiction-writers a predestined opportunity
to endeavor to make the nation acquainted with
itself.</p>
<p><b>Setting as the Hero of the Narrative.</b>&ndash;&ndash;If the setting
be used both to determine the action and to mold the
characters, it may stand forth as the most important
of the three elements of narrative. In Victor Hugo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Notre Dame de Paris,&rdquo; the cathedral is the leading factor
of the story. Claude Frollo would be a very different
person if it were not for the church; and many of
the main events, such as the ultimate tragic scene when
Quasimodo hurls Frollo from the tower-top, could not
happen in any other place. In Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s very
subtle story entitled &ldquo;An Habitation Enforced,&rdquo; which
is included in his &ldquo;Actions and Reactions,&rdquo; the setting
is really the hero of the narrative. An American millionaire
and his wife, whose ancestors were English,
settle for a brief vacation in the county of England from
which the wife&rsquo;s family originally came. Gradually the
old house and the English landscape take hold of them;
ancestral feelings rise to dominate them; and they remain
forever after in enforced habitation on the ancient soil.</p>
<p><b>Uses of the Weather.</b>&ndash;&ndash;All that has been said thus far
of setting in general applies of course to one of the most
interesting of its elements,&ndash;&ndash;the weather. In simple
stories like the usual nursery tale, the weather may be
non-existent. Or it may exist mainly for a decorative
purpose, like the frequent golden oriental dawns of Spenser&rsquo;s
poem or the superb and colorful symphonies of sky
and sea in Pierre Loti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iceland Fisherman.&rdquo; It may
be used as a utilitarian adjunct to the action: at the end
of &ldquo;The Mill on the Floss,&rdquo; as we have already noted, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
rains descend and the flood comes merely for the purpose
of drowning Tom and Maggie. Or it may be employed to
illustrate a character: we are told of Clara Middleton,
in &ldquo;The Egoist,&rdquo; that she possesses the &ldquo;art of dressing
to suit the season and the sky&rdquo;; and therefore the look of
the atmosphere at any hour helps to convey to us a sense
of her appearance. Somewhat more artistically, the
weather may be planned in pre-established harmony with
the mood of the characters: this expedient is wonderfully
used in the wild and wind-swept tales of Fiona MacLeod.
On the other hand, the weather may stand in emotional
contrast with the characters: the Master of Ballantrae and
Mr. Henry fight their duel on a night of absolute stillness
and stifling cold. Again, the weather may be used to
determine the action: in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s early story called
&ldquo;False Dawn,&rdquo; the blinding sandstorm causes Saumarez
to propose to the wrong girl. Or it may be employed as
a controlling influence over character: the tremendous
storm toward the end of &ldquo;Richard Feverel,&rdquo; in the chapter
entitled &ldquo;Nature Speaks,&rdquo; determines the return of
the hero to his wife. In some cases, even, the weather
itself may be the real hero of the narrative: the great eruption
of Vesuvius in &ldquo;The Last Days of Pompeii&rdquo; dominates
the termination of the story.</p>
<p>Although the weather is a subject upon everybody&rsquo;s
tongue, there are very few people who are capable of
talking about it with intelligence and art. Very few
writers of fiction&ndash;&ndash;and nearly all of them are recent&ndash;&ndash;have
exhibited a mastery of the weather,&ndash;&ndash;a mastery
based at once upon a detailed and accurate observation
of natural phenomena and a philosophic sense of the
relation between these phenomena and the concerns of
human beings. Perhaps in no other detail of craftsmanship
does Robert Louis Stevenson so clearly prove his
mastery as in his marshalling of the weather, always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
vividly and truthfully described, to serve a purpose always
fitting to his fictions.</p>
<p><b>Romantic and Realistic Settings.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Let us next consider
the main difference between the merits of a good
romantic and a good realistic setting. Since the realist
leads us to a comprehension of his truth through a careful
imitation of the actual, the thing most to be desired
in a realistic setting is fidelity to fact; and this can be
attained only by accurate observation. But since the
romantic is not bound to imitate the actual, and fabricates
his investiture merely for the sake of embodying
his truth clearly and consistently, the thing most to
be desired in a romantic setting is imaginative fitness to
the action and the characters; and this can sometimes be
attained by artistic inventiveness alone, without display
of observation of the actual. Verisimilitude is of course
the highest merit of either sort of setting; but whereas
verisimilitude with the realist lies in resemblance to
actuality, verisimilitude with the romantic lies rather in
artistic fitness. The distinction may perhaps be best
observed in the historical novels produced by the one and
by the other school. In the setting of realistic historical
novels, like George Eliot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Romola&rdquo; and Flaubert&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Salammb&ocirc;,&rdquo; what the authors have mainly striven for
has been accuracy of detail; but in romantic historical
novels, like those of Scott and Dumas p&egrave;re, the authors
have sought rather for imaginative fitness of setting.
The realists have followed the letter, and the romantics
the spirit, of other times and lands.</p>
<p><b>A Romantic Setting by Edgar Allan Poe.</b>&ndash;&ndash;As an example
of a pure romantic setting, far removed from
actuality and yet thoroughly truthful in artistic fitness
to the action and the characters, we can do no better than
examine the often-quoted opening of Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fall of the
House of Usher&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day
in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively
low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on
horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country;
and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening
drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.
I know not how it was&ndash;&ndash;but, with the first glimpse of
the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my
spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved
by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment
with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon
the scene before me&ndash;&ndash;upon the mere house, and the
simple landscape features of the domain, upon the bleak
walls, upon the vacant eye-like windows, upon a few rank
sedges, and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees&ndash;&ndash;with
an utter depression of soul which I can compare to
no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream
of the reveler upon opium: the bitter lapse into
every-day life, the hideous dropping off of the veil. There
was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart, an unredeemed
dreariness of thought which no goading of the
imagination could torture into aught of the sublime....
It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different
arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details
of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to
annihilate, its capacity for sorrowful impression; and
acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous
brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre
by the dwelling, and gazed down&ndash;&ndash;but with a shudder
even more thrilling than before&ndash;&ndash;upon the remodelled
and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly
tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly this setting bears very little resemblance to
the actual; but just as certainly its artistic fitness to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
tale of terror which it preludes gives it an imaginative
verisimilitude.</p>
<p><b>A Realistic Setting by George Eliot.</b>&ndash;&ndash;As an example of
a realistic setting, closely copying the actual, let us examine
the following passage from &ldquo;Adam Bede&rdquo; (Chapter
XVIII):&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have known it was Sunday if you had only
waked up in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed
to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises; the
very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been
satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine
seemed to call all things to rest and not to labor; it was
asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group
of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked
under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly
on the straw, while her largest young one found
an excellent spring-bed on his mother&rsquo;s fat ribs; on Alick,
the shepherd, in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy
siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the granary
steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no obvious imaginative fitness in this passage,
since in the chapter where it occurs the chief characters
are going to a funeral; but it has an extraordinary verisimilitude,
owing to the author&rsquo;s accurate observation of
the details of life in rural England.</p>
<p><b>The Quality of Atmosphere, or Local Color.</b>&ndash;&ndash;These
two passages differ very widely from each other. In one
thing, and one only, are they alike. Each of them exhibits
the subtle quality called &ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo; This
quality is very difficult to define, though its presence may
be recognized instinctively in any work of graphic art,
like a painting or a description. Without attempting to
define it, we may discover the technical basis for its
presence if we seek out the sole deliberate device in which
these two passages, different as they are in every other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
feature, are at one. It will be noticed that in each of
them the details selected for presentation have been
chosen solely for the sake of a common quality inherent
in them&ndash;&ndash;the quality of sombreness and gloom in the
one case, and the quality of Sabbath quietude in the
other&ndash;&ndash;and that they have been marshalled to convey
a complete sense of this central and pervading quality.
It is commonly supposed that what is called &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;
in a description is dependent upon the setting
forth of a multiplicity of details; but this popular conception
is a fallacy. &ldquo;Atmosphere&rdquo; is dependent rather
upon a strict selection of details pervaded by a common
quality, a rigorous rejection of all others that are dissonant
in mood, and an arrangement of those selected with
a view to exhibiting their common quality as the pervading
spirit of the scene.</p>
<p>This is obviously the technical basis for the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;
of a purely imaginary setting like that of the
melancholy House of Usher. The effect is undeniably
produced by the suppression of all details that do not
contribute to the central sense of gloom. But the same
device underlies (less obviously, to be sure) all such descriptions
of actual places as are rich in &ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo;
What is called &ldquo;local color&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the very look and tone of
a definite locality&ndash;&ndash;is produced not by photographic
multiplicity of details, but by a marshalling of materials
carefully selected to suggest the central spirit of the place
to be depicted. The camera frequently defeats itself by
flinging into emphasis details that are dissonant with the
informing spirit of the scene it seeks to reproduce: so also
does the author who overcrowds his picture with multifarious
details, however faithful they may be to fact.
The true triumphs of &ldquo;local coloring&rdquo; have been made
by men who have struck at the heart and spirit of a place&ndash;&ndash;have
caught its tone and timbre as George Du Maurier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
did with the <i>Quartier Latin</i>&ndash;&ndash;and have set forth only
such details as tingled with this spiritual tone.</p>
<p><b>Recapitulation.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We have studied the many uses of
the element of setting, and have seen that in the best-developed
fiction it has grown to be entirely co&ouml;rdinate
with the elements of character and action. Novelists
have come to consider that any given story can happen
only in a given set of circumstances, and that if the setting
be changed the action must be altered and the characters
be differently drawn. It is therefore impossible,
in the best fiction of the present day, to consider the setting
as divorced from the other elements of the narrative.
There was a time, to be sure, when description for its
own sake existed in the novel, and the action was halted
to permit the introduction of pictorial passages bearing
no necessary relation to the business of the story,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;blocks&rdquo;
of setting, as it were, which might be removed
without detriment to the progression of the narrative.
But the practice of the best contemporary novelists is
summed up and expressed by Henry James in this emphatic
sentence from his essay on &ldquo;The Art of Fiction&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
cannot imagine composition existing in a series of
blocks, nor conceive, in any novel worth discussing at
all, of a passage of description that is not in its intention
narrative.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE POINT OF VIEW IN NARRATIVE</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The Importance of the Point of View&ndash;&ndash;Two Classes, The Internal
and the External&ndash;&ndash;I. Subdivisions of the First Class: 1. The Point
of View of the Leading Actor; 2. The Point of View of Some Subsidiary
Actor; 3. The Points of View of Different Actors; 4. The
Epistolary Point of View.&ndash;&ndash;II. Subdivisions of the Second Class:&ndash;&ndash;1.
The Omniscient Point of View; 2. The Limited Point of
View; 3. The Rigidly Restricted Point of View&ndash;&ndash;Two Tones of
Narrative, Impersonal and Personal: 1. The Impersonal Tone; 2.
The Personal Tone&ndash;&ndash;The Point of View as a Factor in Construction&ndash;&ndash;The
Point of View as the Hero of the Narrative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Importance of the Point of View.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We have now
examined in detail the elements of narrative, and must
next consider the various points of view from which they
may be seen and, in consequence, be represented. Granted
a given series of events to be set forth, the structure of
the plot, the means of character delineation, the use of
setting, the entire tone and tenor of the narrative,
are all dependent directly on the answer to the question,
Who shall tell the story?</p>
<p>For a given train of incidents is differently seen and
judged, according to the standpoint from which it is observed.
The evidence in most important murder trials
consists mainly of successive narratives told by different
witnesses; and it is very interesting to notice, in comparing
them, how very different a tone and tenor is given
to the same event by each of the observers who recounts
it. It remains for the jury to determine, if possible, from
a comparison of the various views of the various witnesses,
what it was that actually happened. But this, in many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
cases, is extremely difficult. One witness saw the action
in one way, another in another; one formed a certain
judgment of the character of the accused, another formed
a judgment diametrically different; each has his separate
sense of the train of causation that culminated in the act;
the accused himself would disagree with all the witnesses,
if indeed he were capable of looking on the facts without
conscious or unconscious self-deception; and we may be
certain that an infallible omniscient mind, cognizant of all
the hidden motives, would see the matter differently still.
The task of the jury is, in the main, to induce from all
these tragic inconsistencies an absolute outlook upon the
real truth that underlies the facts so differently seen and
so variously judged.</p>
<p>Such an absolute outlook is hardly possible to the finite
mind of man; and though it is often assumed by the
writer of fiction in the telling of his tale, it can seldom
be consistently maintained. It is therefore safer to acknowledge
that the absolute truth of a story, whether
actual or fictitious, can never be entirely told; that the
same train of incidents looks different from different
points of view; and that therefore the various points of
view from which any story may be looked upon should be
studied carefully for the purpose of determining from
which of them it is possible, in a given case, to approach
most nearly a clear vision of the truth.</p>
<p><b>Two Classes, The Internal and the External.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The
points of view from which a story may be seen and told
are many and various; but they may all be grouped
into two classes, the internal and the external. A story
seen internally is narrated in the first person by one of
its participants; a story seen externally is narrated in the
third person by a mind aloof from the events depicted.
There are, of course, many variations, both of the internal
and of the external point of view. These in turn must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
examined, for the purpose of determining the special advantages
and disadvantages of each.</p>
<p><b>I. Subdivisions of the First Class: 1. The Point of
View of the Leading Actor.</b>&ndash;&ndash;First of all, a story may be
told by the leading actor in its series of events,&ndash;&ndash;the hero,
as in &ldquo;Henry Esmond,&rdquo; or the heroine, as in &ldquo;Jane
Eyre.&rdquo; This point of view is of especial value in narratives
in which the element of action is predominant. The
multifarious adventures of Gil Blas sound at once more
vivid and more plausible narrated in the first person
than they would sound narrated in the third. When
what is done is either strange or striking, we prefer to
be told about it by the very man who did it. &ldquo;Treasure
Island&rdquo; is narrated by Jim Hawkins, &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; by
David Balfour; and much of the vividness of these exciting
tales depends upon the fact that they are told in
each case by a boy who stood ever in the forefront of the
action. The plausibility of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; is increased
by the convention that the hero is narrating his
own personal experience: in fact Defoe, in all his fictions,
preferred to write in the first person, because what he
sought primarily was plausibility of tone.</p>
<p>This point of view is also of supreme advantage in recounting
personal emotion. Consider for a moment
the following paragraph from &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; (Chapter
X):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my
heart beat like a bird&rsquo;s, both quick and little; and there
was a dimness came before my eyes which I continually
rubbed away, and which continually returned. As for
hope, I had none; but only a darkness of despair and a
sort of anger against all the world that made me long to
sell my life as dear as I was able. I tried to pray, I remember,
but that same hurry of my mind, like a man
running, would not suffer me to think upon the words;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and my chief wish was to have the thing begin and be
done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of experiment, let us go through the
passage, substituting the pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo; for the pronoun
&ldquo;I.&rdquo; Thus:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hardly what is called afraid; but his heart
beat like a bird&rsquo;s, both quick and little; and there was
a dimness came before his eyes which he continually
rubbed away, and which continually returned. As for
hope, he had none....&rdquo; and so forth. Notice how
much vividness is lost,&ndash;&ndash;how much immediacy of emotion.
The zest and tang of the experience is sacrificed,
because the reader is forced to stand aloof and observe
it from afar.</p>
<p>The point of view of the leading actor makes for vividness
in still another way. It necessitates an absolute
concreteness and objectivity in the delineation of the
subsidiary characters. On the other hand, it precludes
analysis of their emotions and their thoughts. The hero
can tell us only what they said and did, how they looked
in action and in speech, and what they seemed to him to
think and feel. But he cannot enter their minds and
delve among their motives. Furthermore, he cannot,
without sacrificing naturalness of mood, analyze to any
great extent his own mental processes. Consequently
it is almost impossible to tell from the hero&rsquo;s point of view
a story in which the main events are mental or subjective.
We can hardly imagine George Eliot writing in the first
person: the &ldquo;psychological novel&rdquo; demands the third.</p>
<p>But the chief difficulty in telling a story from the leading
actor&rsquo;s point of view is the difficulty of characterizing
the narrator. All means of direct delineation are taken
from him. He cannot write essays on his merits or his
faults; he can neither describe nor analyze himself; he
cannot see himself as others see him. We must derive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
our sense of who and what he is, solely from the things
he does and says, and from his manner of telling us about
them. And although it is not especially difficult, within
a brief compass, to delineate a character through his way
of telling things [Notice Laughton O. Zigler, in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Captive,&rdquo; whose speech has been examined
in a former chapter], it is extremely difficult to maintain
this expedient consistently throughout a lengthy
novel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an extended story can be told only by a
person with a well-trained sense of narrative; and it is
often hard to concede to the hero the narrative ability
that he displays. How is it, we may ask, that Jim Hawkins
is capable of such masterly description as that of
&ldquo;the brown old seaman, with the sabre cut,&rdquo; in the
second paragraph of &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo;? How is it that
David Balfour, an untutored boy, is capable of writing
the rhythmic prose of Robert Louis Stevenson, master of
style? And in many cases it is also difficult to concede to
the hero an adequate motive for telling his own story.
Why is it that, in the sequel to &ldquo;Kidnapped,&rdquo; David
Balfour should write out all the intimate details of his
love for Catriona? And how is it conceivable that Jane
Eyre should tell to any one, and least of all to the general
public, the profound privacies of emotion evoked by her
relation with Mr. Rochester?</p>
<p>The answer is, of course, that such violations of the
hard terms of actuality are justified by literary convention;
and that if the gain in vividness be great enough, the
reader will be willing to concede, first, that the story shall
be told by the leading actor, regardless of motive, and
second, that he shall be granted the requisite mastery of
narrative. But the fact remains that it is very hard for
the hero to draw his own character except in outline;
and therefore if the emphasis is to lie less on what he does
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
than on the sort of person that he is, the expedient will be
ineffectual.</p>
<p>The main structural advantage of telling the story
through the person of the hero is that his presence as the
central figure in every event narrated makes for coherence
and gives the story unity. But attendant disadvantages
are that it is often difficult to account for the
hero&rsquo;s presence in every scene, that he cannot be an eye-witness
to events happening at the same time in different
places, and that it is hard to account for his possession
of knowledge regarding those details of the plot which
have no immediate bearing on himself. It seems always
somewhat lame to state, as heroes telling their own stories
are frequently obliged to do, &ldquo;These things I did not
know at the time, and found out only afterward; but
I insert them here, because it is at this point in the plot
that they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>2. The Point of View of Some Subsidiary Actor.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Many
of these disadvantages may be overcome by telling
the tale from the point of view, not of the leading
actor, but of some minor personage in the story. In this
case again, analysis of character is precluded; but the
narrator may delineate the leading actor directly, through
descriptive and expository comment. In stories where
the hero is an extraordinary person, and could not without
immodesty descant upon his own unusual capabilities,
it is of obvious advantage to represent him from the
point of view of an admiring friend. Thus when Poe
invented the detective story, he wisely decided to exhibit
the extraordinary analytic power of Dupin through a
narrative told not by the detective himself but by a man
who knew him well; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, following
in his footsteps, has invented Dr. Watson to tell
the tales of Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p>The actual instance of Boswell and Johnson substantiates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the possibility of a minor actor&rsquo;s knowing intimately
all phases of a hero&rsquo;s life and character. And since the
point of view of the secondary personage is just as internal
to the events themselves as that of the leading actor, the
story may be told with an immediacy, a vividness, and a
plausibility approximating closely the effect derived from
a narrative told by the hero. And there is now less difficulty
in accounting for the narrator&rsquo;s knowledge of all the
details of the plot. He can witness minor necessary
scenes at which the hero is not present; he can know
things (and tell them to the reader) which at the time the
hero did not know; and if his presence be withheld from
an important incident, the hero can narrate it to him
afterward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is often very difficult to maintain
throughout a long story the point of view of a minor actor
in the plot. Thackeray breaks down completely in his
attempt to tell &ldquo;The Newcomes&rdquo; from the point of view
of Arthur Pendennis, the hero of a former novel. Stevenson
assigns to Mackellar the task of narrating &ldquo;The
Master of Ballantrae&rdquo;: but when the Master disappears
and Mackellar remains at home with Mr. Henry, it is
necessary for the author to invent a second personage,
the Chevalier de Burke, to tell the story of the Master&rsquo;s
wanderings.</p>
<p><b>3. The Points of View of Different Actors.</b>&ndash;&ndash;This last
instance leads us to consider the possibility of telling
different sections of the story from the points of view of
different characters, assigning to each the particular
phase of the narrative that he is especially fitted to recount.
Three quarters of the &ldquo;Strange Case of Doctor
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&rdquo; is narrated in the third person,
externally; but the final intimate vividness of horror is
gained by shifting to an internal point of view for the
two concluding chapters,&ndash;&ndash;the first written by Dr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
Lanyon, and the last by Jekyll himself. Mr. Kipling
has developed to very subtle uses the expedient of opening
a story from the point of view of a narrator who is
named simply &ldquo;I&rdquo; and who is not characterized in any
way at all, and then letting the story proper be told to
this impersonal narrator by several characters who are
clearly delineated through their speech and through the
parts that they have played in the tale that they are telling.
This device is used in nearly all the stories of the
&ldquo;Soldiers Three.&rdquo; The narrator meets Mulvaney,
Ortheris, and Learoyd under certain circumstances, and
gathers from them bit by bit the various features of the
story,&ndash;&ndash;one detail being contributed by one of the actors,
another by another, until out of the successive fragments
the story is built up. It is in this way also, as we have
already noted, that the tale of Mrs. Bathurst is set before
the reader.</p>
<p><b>4. The Epistolary Point of View.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A convenient means
of shifting the burden of the narrative at any point to a
certain special character is to introduce a letter written
by that character to one of the other people in the plot.
This expedient is employed with extraordinary cleverness
by George Meredith in &ldquo;Evan Harrington.&rdquo; Most of
the tale is told externally; but every now and then the
clever and witty Countess de Saldar writes a letter in
which a leading incident is illuminated from her personal
point of view.</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Richardson the device has frequently
been used of telling an entire story through a
series of letters exchanged among the characters. The
main advantage of this method is the constant shifting
of the point of view, which makes it possible for the
reader to see every important incident through the eyes
of each of the characters in turn. Furthermore, it is comparatively
easy to characterize in the first person when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
the thing that is written is so intimate and personal as a
letter. But the disadvantage of the device lies in the fact
that it tends toward incoherence in the structure of the
narrative. It is hard for the author to stick to the point
at every moment without violating the casual and discursive
tone that the epistolary style demands.</p>
<p>Of course a certain unity may be gained if the letters
used are all written by a single character. The chief
advantage of this method over a direct narrative written
by one of the actors is the added motive for the revelation
of intimate matters which is furnished by the fact that the
narrator is writing, not for the public at large, but only
for the friend, or friends, to whom the letters are addressed.
But a series of letters written by one person
only is very likely to become monotonous; and more is
usually gained than lost by assigning the epistolary r&ocirc;le
successively to different characters.</p>
<p><b>II. Subdivisions of the Second Class.</b>&ndash;&ndash;We have seen
that, although the employment of an internal point
of view gives a narrative vividness of action, objectivity
of observation, immediacy of emotion, and plausibility
of tone, it is attended by several difficulties in the delineation
of the characters and the construction of the plot.
It is therefore in many cases more advisable for the author
to look upon the narrative externally and to write
it in the third person. But there are several different
ways of doing this; for though a story viewed externally
is told in every case by a mind distinct from that of any of
the characters, there are many different stations in which
that mind may set itself, and many different moods in
which it may recount the story.</p>
<p><b>1. The Omniscient Point of View.</b>&ndash;&ndash;First of all (to
start with a phase that contrasts most widely with the
internal point of view) the external mind may set itself
equidistant from all the characters and may assume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
toward them an attitude of absolute omniscience. The
story, in such a case, is told by a sort of god, who is cognizant
of the past and future of the action while he is
looking at the present, and who sees into the minds and
hearts of all the characters at once and understands them
better than they do themselves.</p>
<p>The main practical advantage in assuming the god-like
point of view is that the narrator is never obliged to account
for his possession of intimate information. He can
observe events which happen at the same time in places
widely separated. Darkness cannot dim his eyes; locked
doors cannot shut him out. He can be with a character
when that character is most alone. He can make clear
to us the thoughts that do not tremble into speech, the
emotions that falter and subside into inaction. He can
know, and can convey to us, how much of a person&rsquo;s real
thought is expressed, and how much is concealed, by the
language that he uses. And the reader seeks no motive
to account for the narrator&rsquo;s revelation of the personal
secrets of the characters.</p>
<p>The omniscient point of view is the only one that permits
upon a large scale the depiction of character through
mental analysis. It is therefore usually used in the
&ldquo;psychological novel.&rdquo; It was employed always by
George Eliot, and was selected almost always by George
Meredith. It is, of course, invaluable for telling the sort
of story whose main events are mental, or subjective. A
spiritual experience which does not translate itself into
concrete action can be viewed adequately only from the
god-like point of view. But when it is employed in the
narration of objective events, the writer runs the danger
of undue abstractness. A certain vividness&ndash;&ndash;a certain
immediacy of observation&ndash;&ndash;are likely to be lost, because
of the aloofness from the characters of the mind that sees
them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>This point of view is at once the most easy and the
most difficult that the author may assume. Technically
it is the easiest, because the writer is absolutely free in
the selection and the patterning of his narrative materials;
but humanly it is the most difficult, because it is hard for
any man consistently to play the god, even toward his
own fictitious creatures. Although George Eliot assumes
omniscience of Daniel Deronda, the consensus of
opinion among men of sound judgment is that she does
not really know her hero. Deronda is in truth a lesser
person than she thinks him; and her assumption of omniscience
breaks down. In fact, unless an author is
gifted with the god-like wisdom of George Meredith, he is
almost sure to break down in the effort to sustain the
omniscient attitude consistently throughout a complicated
novel.</p>
<p><b>2. The Limited Point of View.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Therefore, in assuming
a point of view external to the characters, it is usually
wiser for the author to accept a compromise and to impose
certain definite limits upon his own omniscience.
Thus, while maintaining the prerogative to enter at any
moment the minds of one or more of his characters, he
may limit his observation of the others to what was
actually seen and heard of them by those of whose minds
he is omniscient. In such a case, although the author
tells the story in the third person, he virtually sees the
story from the point of view of a certain actor, or
of certain actors, in it. The only phase of this device
which we need to examine is that wherein the novelist&rsquo;s
omniscience is limited to a single character.</p>
<p>This special point of view is employed with consummate
art by Jane Austen. In &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; for example,
she portrays every intimate detail of the heroine&rsquo;s
thoughts and feelings, entering Emma&rsquo;s mind at will,
or looking at her from the outside with omniscient eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
But in dealing with the other characters, the author
limits her own knowledge to what Emma knew about
them, and sees them consistently through the eyes of
the heroine. Hence the story, although written by
Jane Austen in the third person, is really seen by Emma
Woodhouse and thought of in the first. Similarly, in
&ldquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rdquo; Elizabeth Bennet is the only
character that the author permits herself to analyze
at any length: the others are seen objectively, merely
as Elizabeth saw them. The reader is made acquainted
with every step in the heroine&rsquo;s gradual change of
feeling toward Mr. Darcy; but of the change in Darcy&rsquo;s
thoughts and feelings toward Elizabeth the reader is
told nothing until she herself discovers it.</p>
<p>Of course, in applying this device, it is possible for the
author, at certain points in the narrative, to shift his
limited omniscience from one of the characters to another.
In such a case, although the story is told throughout
consistently in the third person, one scene may be
viewed from the standpoint of one of the characters, another
from that of another character, and so on.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment two adjacent rooms with a
single door between them which is locked; and suppose
a character alone in each of the rooms,&ndash;&ndash;each person
thinking of the other. Now an author assuming absolute
omniscience could tell us what each of them was
thinking at the selfsame moment: the locked door
would not be a bar to him. But an author telling the
story from the attitude of limited omniscience could
tell us only what one of them was thinking, and would
not be able to see beyond the door. Whether or not
he would find himself at liberty to choose which room
he should be cognizant of, would depend of course on
whether he was maintaining the same point of view
throughout his story or was selecting it anew for every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
scene. In the first case, the one character whom he
could see would be determined in advance: in the other,
he should have to decide from the point of view of
which of them that special scene could be the more
effectively set forth.</p>
<p>The attitude of limited omniscience is more easy to
maintain than that of a god-like mind intimately cognizant
of all the characters at once; and furthermore,
the employment of the more restricted point of view is
more likely to produce the illusion of life. In actual
experience, we see only one mind internally,&ndash;&ndash;our own;
all other people we look upon externally: and a story,
therefore, which lays bare to us one mind and only one
is more in tune with life itself than a story in which
many minds are searched by an all-seeing eye. Also,
a story told in the third person from the point of view
which has been illustrated from Jane Austen&rsquo;s novels
enjoys nearly every advantage of a narrative told in
the first person by the leading actor, without being
encumbered by certain of the most noticeable disadvantages.</p>
<p><b>3. The Rigidly Restricted Point of View.</b>&ndash;&ndash;For the
sake of concreteness, however, it is often advisable for
the author writing in the third person to restrict his
point of view still further, and, foregoing absolutely
the prerogative of omniscience, to limit himself to an
attitude merely observant and entirely external to all
the characters. In such a case the author wears, as
it were, an invisible cap like that of Fortunatus, which
permits him to move unnoticed among his characters;
and he reports to us externally their looks, their actions,
and their speech, without ever assuming an ability to
delve into their minds. This rigidly external point of
view is employed frequently by Guy de Maupassant
in his briefer fictions; but although it is especially valuable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
in the short-story, it is extremely difficult to
maintain through the extensive compass of a novel.
The main advantage of this point of view is that it
necessitates upon the part of the author an attitude
toward his story which is at all moments visual rather
than intellectual. He does not give a ready-made
interpretation of his incidents, but merely projects them
before the eyes of his readers and allows to each the
privilege of interpreting them for himself. But, on
the other hand, the reader loses the advantage of the
novelist&rsquo;s superior knowledge of his creatures: and,
except in dramatic moments when the motives are
self-evident from the action, may miss the human purport
of the scene.</p>
<p><b>Two Tones of Narrative, Impersonal and Personal:
1. The Impersonal Tone.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In employing every phase
of the external point of view except the one which has
been last discussed, the author is free to choose between
two very different tones of narrative,&ndash;&ndash;the impersonal
and the personal. He may either obliterate or emphasize
his own personality as a factor in the story. The
great epics and folk-tales have all been told impersonally.
Whatever sort of person Homer may have been, he
never obtrudes himself into his narrative; and we may
read both the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; without
deriving any more definite sense of his personality than
may be drawn from the hints which are given us by
the things he knows about. No one knows the author
of &ldquo;Beowulf&rdquo; or of the &ldquo;Nibelungen Lied.&rdquo; These
stories seem to tell themselves. They are seen from
nobody&rsquo;s point of view, or from anybody&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;whichever
way we choose to say it. Many modern authors,
like Sir Walter Scott, instinctively assume the epic
attitude toward their characters and incidents: they
look upon them with a large unconsciousness of self
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and depict them just as any one would see them. Other
authors, like Mr. William Dean Howells, strive deliberately
to keep the personal note out of their stories:
self-consciously they triumph over self in the endeavor
to leave their characters alone.</p>
<p><b>2. The Personal Tone.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But novelists of another
class prefer to admit frankly to the reader that the
narrator who stands apart from all the characters and
writes about them in the third person is the author
himself. They give a personal tone to the narrative;
they assert their own peculiarities of taste and judgment,
and never let you forget that they, and they
alone, are telling the story. The reader has to see it
through their eyes. It is in this way, for example, that
Thackeray displays his stories,&ndash;&ndash;pitying his characters,
admiring them, making fun of them, or loving them,
and never letting slip an opportunity to chat about
the matter with his readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Howells, in Section XV of his &ldquo;Criticism and
Fiction,&rdquo; comments adversely on Thackeray&rsquo;s tendency
&ldquo;to stand about in his scene, talking it over with his
hands in his pockets, interrupting the action, and spoiling
the illusion in which alone the truth of art resides&rdquo;;
and in a further sentence he condemns him as &ldquo;a writer
who had so little artistic sensibility, that he never
hesitated on any occasion, great or small, to make a
foray among his characters, and catch them up to show
them to the reader and tell him how beautiful or ugly
they were; and cry out over their amazing properties.&rdquo;
This sweeping condemnation of the narrative attitude
of one of the best-beloved of the great masters sounds
just a little bigoted. It is true, of course, that the
strictest artists in fiction, like Guy de Maupassant,
prefer to tell their tales impersonally: they leave their
characters rigidly alone, and allow the reader to see them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
without looking through the author&rsquo;s personality. But
there is a type of literature wherein the chief charm
for the reader lies in the fact that he is permitted to see
things through the author&rsquo;s mind. When we read
Charles Lamb&rsquo;s essay on &ldquo;The South Sea House,&rdquo; we
read it not so much to look at the deserted and memorable
building as to look at Elia looking at it. Similarly
many readers return again and again to &ldquo;The Newcomes&rdquo;
not so much for the pleasure of seeing London
high society as for the pleasure of seeing Thackeray see
it. The merit, or the defect, of the method in any case
is a question not of rules and regulations but of the tone
and quality of the author&rsquo;s mind. Whether or not he
may safely obtrude himself into his fictions depends
entirely on who he is. This is a matter more of personality
than of art: and what might be insufferable with
one author may stand as the main merit of another.
For instance, the greatest charm of Sir James Barrie&rsquo;s
novels emanates from the author&rsquo;s habit of emphasizing
the personal relation between himself and his characters.
The author&rsquo;s many-mooded attitude toward
Sentimental Tommy is a matter of human interest just
as much as anything that Tommy feels himself.</p>
<p>Let us admit, then, in spite of Mr. Howells, that the
author of fiction has a right to assert himself as the narrator,
provided that he be a person of interest and charm.
It remains for us to consider the various moods in which,
in such a case, the writer may look upon his story. The
self-obliterating author endeavors to hide his own opinion
of the characters, in order not to interfere with the
reader&rsquo;s independence of judgment concerning them;
but the author who writes personally does not hesitate
to reveal, nor even to express directly, his admiration of
a character&rsquo;s merits or his deprecation of a character&rsquo;s
defects. You will seek in vain, in studying the fictitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
people of Guy de Maupassant, for any indication
of the author&rsquo;s approval or disapproval of them; and
there is something very admirable in this absolute impassiveness
of art. But on the other hand, there is a certain
salutary humanness about an author who loves or
hates his characters just as he would love or hate the
same sort of people in actual life, and writes about them
with the glow of personal emotion. Sir James Barrie
often disapproves of Tommy; sometimes he feels forced
to scold him; but he loves him for a&rsquo; that: and we feel
instinctively that the hero is the more truthfully delineated
for being represented by a friend.</p>
<p><b>The Point of View as a Factor in Construction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It
will be gathered from the foregoing discussion of the
various points of view in narrative that no one of them
may be pronounced absolutely better than the others.
But this much may be said dogmatically: there is
always one best point of view from which to tell any
given short-story; and although in planning a novel the
author works with far less technical restriction, there is
almost always one best point of view from which to
tell a given novel. Therefore, it is advisable for the
author to determine as early as possible, from a studious
consideration of his materials, what is the best point of
view from which to tell the story he is planning, and
thereafter to contemplate his narrative from that standpoint
and that only. Furthermore, the interest of art
demands that the point of view selected shall, if possible,
be maintained consistently throughout the telling of the
story. This, however, is a very difficult matter; and
only in very recent years have even the best writers
grown to master it. The novels which have been told
without a single violation of this principle are very few
in number. But the fact remains that any unwarrantable
breakdown in the point of view selected diseconomizes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
the attention of the reader. It is unfortunate,
for instance, that Thomas Bailey Aldrich, in &ldquo;Marjorie
Daw,&rdquo; should have found it necessary, after telling
almost the entire tale in letters, to shift suddenly to the
external point of view and end the story with a few pages
of direct narrative. Such an unexpected variation of
method startles and to some extent disrupts the attention
of the reader, and thereby detracts from the effect
of the thing to be conveyed.</p>
<p>Henry James and Mr. Kipling exhibit, in their several
ways, extraordinary mastery of point of view; and
their works may very profitably be studied for examples
of this special phase of artistry in narrative. The very
title of &ldquo;What Maisie Knew&rdquo;, by Henry James, proclaims
the rigidly restricted standpoint from which the
narrative material is seen. In Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s tale, &ldquo;A
Deal in Cotton,&rdquo; which is included in &ldquo;Actions and
Reactions,&rdquo; the interest is derived chiefly from the trick
of telling the story twice,&ndash;&ndash;first from the point of view of
Adam Strickland, and the second time from the point of
view of Adam&rsquo;s native body-servant, who knew many
matters that were hidden from his master.</p>
<p><b>The Point of View as the Hero of the Narrative.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In
certain special cases the point of view has been made,
so to speak, the real hero of the story. Some years
ago Mr. Brander Matthews, in collaboration with the
late H. C. Bunner, devised a very clever narrative
entitled &ldquo;The Documents in the Case.&rdquo; It consisted
merely of a series of numbered documents, widely different
in nature, presented with neither introduction
nor comment by the authors. The series contained
clippings from various newspapers, personal letters,
I. O. U&rsquo;s, race-track reports, pawn-tickets, letter-heads,
telegrams, theatre programmes, advertisements, receipted
bills, envelopes, etc. In spite of the diversity of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
materials, the authors succeeded in fabricating a narrative
which was entirely coherent and at all points
clear. The main interest, however, lay in the novelty
and cleverness of the point of view; and though such an
exaggerated technical expedient may be serviceable now
and then for a special sort of story, it is not of any general
value. A point of view that attracts attention to
itself necessarily distracts attention from the story that
is being represented; and in a narrative of serious import,
the main emphasis should be thrown upon the thing that
is told rather than upon the way of telling it.</p>

<h3>EMPHASIS IN NARRATIVE</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Essential and Contributory Features&ndash;&ndash;Art Distinguishes Between
the Two by Emphasis&ndash;&ndash;Many Technical Devices: 1. Emphasis by
Terminal Position; 2. Emphasis by Initial Position; 3. Emphasis
by Pause [Further Discussion of Emphasis by Position]; 4. Emphasis
by Direct Proportion; 5. Emphasis by Inverse Proportion;
6. Emphasis by Iteration; 7. Emphasis by Antithesis; 8. Emphasis

11. Emphasis by Imitative Movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Essential and Contributory Features.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The features
of any object that we contemplate may with intelligent
judgment be divided into two classes, according as they
are inherently essential, or else merely contributory,
to the existence of that object as an individual entity.
If any one of its inherently essential features should be
altered, that object would cease to be itself and would
become another object; but if any or all of its merely
contributory features should be changed, the object
would still retain its individuality, however much its
aspect might be altered. And in general it may be said
that we do not understand an object until we are able
to set intelligently in one group or the other every feature
it presents to our attention.</p>
<p><b>Art Distinguishes Between the Two by Emphasis.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In
contemplating natural objects, it is often difficult to
distinguish those features which are merely contributory
from those which are inherently essential; but it ought
not to be difficult to do so in contemplating a work of
art. For it is possible for the artist&ndash;&ndash;in fact it is incumbent
upon him&ndash;&ndash;to help the observer to distinguish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
clearly between the essential and the contributory
details of the object he has fabricated. By employing
certain technical expedients in exhibiting his work, the
artist is able to communicate to the observer his own
intelligent distinction between its more important, and
its less important, features. He does this by casting
emphasis upon the necessary details and gathering out
of emphasis the subsidiary ones.</p>
<p>The importance of the principle of emphasis is recognized
in all the arts; for it is only by an application of
this principle that the artist can gather and group in
the background the subsidiary elements of his work,
while he flings into vivid relief those elements that embody
the essence of the thing he has to say. The halo
with which the Byzantine mosa&iuml;cists surrounded the
faces of their saints, the glory of golden light that gleams
about the figure of Christ in heaven in Tintoretto&rsquo;s
decorations, the blank bright walls of the Doge&rsquo;s palace
undermined by darkling and shadowy arcades, the
refrain of a Proven&ccedil;al song, the sharp shadow under the
visor of Verrocchio&rsquo;s equestrian statue, the thought-provoking
chiaroscuro of Rembrandt&rsquo;s figure paintings&ndash;&ndash;these
expedients are all designed to attract attention to
the essential elements of a whole of many parts. By
technical devices such as these, emphasis must be given
to the central truth of a work of art in order that the
observer may not look instead at the mere accidents of
its investiture. Where many elements are gathered
together for the purpose of representing an idea, some of
them must be more important than the others because
they are to a greater extent imbued with it inherently;
and the artist will fail of his purpose unless he indicates
clearly which elements are essential and which are merely
subsidiary.</p>
<p><b>Many Technical Devices.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Scarcely any other work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
of art, excepting a Gothic cathedral or a theatrical performance,
is made of elements more multifarious than
those of a fictitious narrative. The details of a novel
are so many and so various that the author needs at all
times a nice understanding and a careful application
of the principle of emphasis. It is therefore advisable
that the present chapter should be devoted to the enumeration
and illustration of the different technical devices
which are employed by artists in narrative to cast the
needed emphasis on the essential features of their stories.</p>
<p><b>1. Emphasis by Terminal Position.</b>&ndash;&ndash;First of all, it is
obviously easy to emphasize by position. In any narrative,
or section of a narrative, that is designed to be read
in a single sitting, the last moments are of necessity
emphatic because they are the last. When the reader
lays the narrative aside, he remembers most vividly the
last thing that has been presented to his attention; and
if he thinks back to the earlier portions of the story, he
must do so by thinking through the concluding passage.
Therefore, it is necessary in the short-story, and advisable
in the chapters of a novel, to reserve for the ultimate position
one of the most inherently important features of the
narrative; for surely it is bad art to waste the natural
emphasis of position by casting it upon a subsidiary
feature.</p>
<p>The importance of this simple expedient will readily
be recognized if the student will gather together a hundred
short-stories written by acknowledged masters and
examine the last paragraph of each. Consider for a
moment the final sentences of &ldquo;Markheim,&rdquo; which we
have already quoted in another connection:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He confronted the maid upon the threshold with
something like a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had better go for the police,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;I have
killed your master.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>The entire story is summed up in the concluding
phrase; and the final sentence rings ever after in the
reader&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>Here, to cite a new example, is the conclusion of Poe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Masque of the Red Death&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red
Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one
by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls
of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of
his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with
that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods
expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death
held illimitable dominion over all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sense of absolute ruin which we derive from this
impressive paragraph is, to a considerable extent, due to
the emphasis it gains from its finality. The effect would
unquestionably be subtracted from, if another paragraph
should be appended and should steal away its importance
of position.</p>
<p>In order to derive the utmost emphasis from the terminal
position, the great artist Guy de Maupassant, in
his short-stories, developed a periodicity of structure by
means of which he reserved the solution of the narrative,
whenever possible, until the final sentences. This periodic
structure is employed, for example, in his well-known
story of &ldquo;The Necklace&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>La Parure</i>&rdquo;). It
deals with a poor woman who loses a diamond necklace
that she has borrowed from a rich friend in order to wear
at a ball. She buys another exactly like it and returns
this in its place. For ten years she and her husband
labor day and night to pay off the debts they have incurred
to purchase the substituted jewels. After the
debts are all paid, the woman tells her friend of what
had happened. Then follows this last sentence of the
story:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, my poor Mathilde. But mine were false. At
most they were worth five hundred francs!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The periodic pattern of Guy de Maupassant was
sedulously copied by O. Henry; but this popular contributor
to the American magazines went even further
than his master and developed a double surprise to be
delivered suddenly at the conclusion of the narrative.
A typical example of his work is &ldquo;The Gift of the Magi,&rdquo;
wherein an unexpected outcome is immediately capped
by a second outcome still more unexpected. The success
of O. Henry with the reading public may be attributed
mainly to his cleverness in taking full advantage of the
powerful expedient of emphasis by terminal position.
His technical adroitness may be studied best by reading
rapidly the final paragraphs of any hundred of his stories.
He had the happy faculty of saying last the best and
brightest thing he had to say.</p>
<p><b>2. Emphasis by Initial Position.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Next to the last
position, the most emphatic place in a brief narrative, or
section of a narrative, is of course the first. The mind
of the reader receives with an especial vividness whatever
is presented to it at the outset. For this reason it is
necessary in the short-story, and advisable in the chapters
of a novel, to begin with material that not only is inherently
essential, but also strikes the key-note of the narrative
that is to follow. Edgar Allan Poe is especially
artistic in applying this principle of emphasis by initial
position. We have already quoted, in another connection,
the solemn opening of &ldquo;The Fall of the House
of Usher,&rdquo; with its suggestion of immitigable gloom of
setting as the dominant note of the narrative. In &ldquo;The
Cask of Amontillado,&rdquo; wherein the thing to be emphasized
is the element of action, Poe begins with this
sentence: &ldquo;The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had
borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
I vowed revenge&rdquo;: and we know already that the story is
to set forth a signal act of vengeance. In &ldquo;The Tell-Tale
Heart,&rdquo; which is a study of murderous madness, and deals
primarily with the element of character, the author opens
thus:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True!&ndash;&ndash;nervous&ndash;&ndash;very, very dreadfully nervous I
had been and am; but why <i>will</i> you say that I am mad?
The disease had sharpened my senses&ndash;&ndash;not destroyed&ndash;&ndash;not
dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing
acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.
I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad?
Hearken! and observe how healthily&ndash;&ndash;how calmly I can
tell you the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>3. Emphasis by Pause.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In general it may be said
that any pause in a narrative emphasizes by position
whatever immediately precedes it, and also (though to a
considerably less extent) whatever immediately follows
it. For this reason many masters of the short-story,
like Daudet and de Maupassant, construct their narratives
in sections, in order to multiply the number of
terminal and initial positions. Asterisks strung across
the page not only make the reader aware of the completion
of an integral portion of the story, but also focus his
attention emphatically on the last thing that has been
said before the interruption. The employment of
<i>points de suspension</i>&ndash;&ndash;a mark of punctuation consisting
of a series of successive dots ...&ndash;&ndash;which is so frequent
with French authors, is a device which is used to
interrupt a sentence solely for the sake of emphasis by
pause.</p>
<p><b>Further Discussion of Emphasis by Position.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The
instances which we have selected to illustrate the expedient
of emphasizing by position have been chosen for
convenience from short-stories; but the same principle
may be applied with similar success in constructing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
chapters of a novel. Certain great but inartistic novelists,
like Sir Walter Scott, show themselves to be singularly
obtuse to the advantage of placing emphatic material
in an emphatic position. Scott is almost always
careless of his chapter endings: he allows the sections of
his narrative to drift and straggle, instead of rounding
them to an emphatic close. But more artistic novelists,
like Victor Hugo for example, never fail to take advantage
of the terminal position. Consider the close of Book XI,
Chapter II, of &ldquo;Notre Dame de Paris.&rdquo; The gypsy-girl,
Esmeralda, has been hanged in the Place de Gr&egrave;ve. The
hunchback, Quasimodo, has flung the archdeacon, Claude
Frollo, from the tower-top of Notre Dame. This paragraph
then brings the chapter to an end:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quasimodo then raised his eye to the gypsy, whose
body he saw, depending from the gibbet, shudder afar
under her white robe with the last tremblings of death-agony;
then he lowered it to the archdeacon, stretched
out at the foot of the tower and no longer having human
form; and he said with a sob that made his deep chest
heave: &lsquo;Oh! all that I have loved!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chapter ending may be artistically planned either
(as in the foregoing instance) to sum up with absolute
finality the narrative accomplishment of the chapter, or
else, by vaguely foreshadowing the subsequent progress
of the story, to lure the reader to proceed. The elder
Dumas possessed in a remarkable degree the faculty of
so terminating one chapter as to allure the reader to an
immediate commencement of the next. He did this
most frequently by introducing a new thread of narrative
in a phrase of the concluding sentence, and thereby exciting
the reader&rsquo;s curiosity to follow up the thread.</p>
<p>The expedient of emphasis by terminal and by initial
position cannot, of course, be applied without reservation
to an entire novel. The last chapter of a novel with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
complicated plot is often of necessity devoted to tying or
untying minor knots in the straggling threads of the
general network. Therefore, the most emphatic place
in an extended narrative is not at the very end, but rather
at the close of the chapter which sets forth the culmination.
Also, although many great novels, like &ldquo;The
Scarlet Letter,&rdquo; have begun at an emphatic moment in
the plot, many others have opened slowly and have presented
no important material until the narrative was well
under way. &ldquo;The Talisman&rdquo; of Scott, &ldquo;The Spy&rdquo; of
Fenimore Cooper, and many another early nineteenth-century
romance, began with a solitary horseman whom
the reader was forced to follow for several pages before
anything whatever happened. Latterly, however, novelists
have learned from writers of short-stories the art of
opening emphatically with material important to the
plot.</p>
<p><b>4. Emphasis by Direct Proportion.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Another means
of emphasis in narrative is by proportion. More time
and more attention should be given to essential scenes
than to matters of subsidiary interest. The most important
characters should be given most to say and do;
and the amount of attention devoted to the others should
be proportioned to their importance in the action.
Becky Sharp stands out sharply from the half a hundred
other characters in &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; because more time
is devoted to her than to any of the others. Similarly,
in &ldquo;Emma&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rdquo; as we have
noted in the preceding chapter, the heroine is in each
case emphasized by the fact that she is set forth from
a more intimate point of view than the minor people in
the story. It is wise, for the sake of emphasis by proportion,
to draw the major characters more completely and
more carefully than the minor; and much may therefore
be said, on this ground, in defence of Dickens&rsquo;s habit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
drawing humanly only the leading characters in his
novels and merely sketching in caricature the subsidiary
actors.</p>
<p><b>5. Emphasis by Inverse Proportion.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is sometimes
possible, in special cases, to emphasize ironically by inverse
proportion. An author may deliberately devote
several successive pages to dwelling on subsidiary matters,
only to emphasize sharply a sudden paragraph or sentence
in which he turns to the one thing that really counts.
But this ironical expedient is, of course, less frequently
serviceable than that of emphasis by direct proportion.</p>
<p><b>6. Emphasis by Iteration.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Undoubtedly the easiest
means of inculcating a detail of narrative is to repeat it
again and again. Emphasis by iteration is a favorite
device of Dickens. The reader is never allowed to forget
the catch-phrase of Micawber or the moral look of
Pecksniff. In many cases, to be sure, the reader wishes
that he might escape the constantly recurrent repetition;
but Dickens occasionally applies the expedient with
subtle emotional effect. In &ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo; for
example, the repeated references to echoing footsteps
and to the knitting of Madame Defarge contribute a
great deal to the sense of imminent catastrophe.</p>
<p>Certain modern authors have developed a phase of
emphasis by iteration which is similar to the employment
of the <i>leit-motiv</i> in the music-dramas of Richard Wagner.
In the Wagnerian operas a certain musical theme is
devoted to each of the characters, and is woven into the
score whenever the character appears. Similarly, in the
later plays of Henrik Ibsen, certain phrases are repeated
frequently, to indicate the recurrence of certain dramatic
moods. Thus, in &ldquo;Rosmersholm,&rdquo; reference is made to
the weird symbol of &ldquo;white horses,&rdquo; whenever the mood
of the momentary scene foreshadows the double suicide
which is to terminate the play. Students of &ldquo;Hedda
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Gabler&rdquo; need not be reminded of the emphasis flung by
iteration on the phrases, &ldquo;Vine-leaves in his hair,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fancy that, Hedda!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wavy-haired Thea,&rdquo; &ldquo;The one
cock on the fowl-roost,&rdquo; and &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t do such
things!&rdquo; The same device may be employed just as
effectively in the short-story and the novel. A single
instance will suffice for illustration. Notice, in examining
the impressive talk of the old lama in Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Kim,&rdquo; how much emphasis is derived from the continual
recurrence of certain phrases, like the &ldquo;Search for
the River,&rdquo; &ldquo;the justice of the Wheel,&rdquo; &ldquo;to acquire
merit,&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>A narrative expedient scarcely distinguishable in effect
from simple iteration is the device of parallelism of structure.
For example, in Hawthorne&rsquo;s story of &ldquo;The White
Old Maid,&rdquo; the first scene and the last, although they are
separated in time by many, many years, take place in the
same spacious chamber, with the moonbeams falling in
the same way through two deep and narrow windows,
while waving curtains produce the same ghostly semblance
of expression on a face that is dead.</p>
<p><b>7. Emphasis by Antithesis.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Emphasis in narrative
is also attained by antithesis,&ndash;&ndash;an expedient employed
in every art. In most stories it is well so to select the
characters that they will set each other off by contrast.
In the great duel scene of the &ldquo;Master of Ballantrae,&rdquo;
from which a selection has been quoted in a previous
chapter, the phlegmatic calm of Mr. Henry is contrasted
sharply with the mercurial hot-headedness of the Master;
and each character stands forth more vividly because of
its opposition to the other. Of the two women who are
loved by Tito Melema, the one, Tessa, is simple and
childish, the other, Romola, complex and intellectual.
The most interesting stories present a constant contrast
of mutually foiling personalities; and whenever characters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
of varied views and opposing aims come nobly to the
grapple in a struggle that vitally concerns them, the
tensity of the situation will be augmented if the difference
between the characters is marked. This expedient is
therefore of especial importance in the drama. Othello
seems more poignantly emotional in the presence of the
coldly intellectual Iago. In &ldquo;The School for Scandal,&rdquo;
Charles and Joseph Surface are much more effective
together than either of them would be alone. The wholehearted
and happy-go-lucky recklessness of the one sets
off the smooth and smug dissimulation of the other; the
first gives light to the play, and the second shade. Hamlet&rsquo;s
wit is sharpened by the garrulous obtuseness of Polonius;
the sad world-wisdom of Paula Tanqueray is
accentuated by the innocence of Ellean. Similarly, to
return to the novel for examples, we need only instance
the contrast in mind between Sherlock Holmes and Dr.
Watson, the contrast in mood between Claude Frollo
and Phoebus de Ch&acirc;teaupers, the contrast in ideals between
Daniel Deronda and Gwendolen Grandcourt.</p>
<p>The expedient of antithesis is also employed effectively
in the balance of scene against scene. The absolute
desolation which terminates &ldquo;The Masque of the Red
Death&rdquo; is preceded by &ldquo;a masked ball of the most unusual
magnificence.&rdquo; In Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kenilworth,&rdquo; we pass
from the superb festivities which Leicester institutes in
honor of Queen Elizabeth, to the lonely prison where
Amy Robsart, his discarded wife, is languishing. Victor
Hugo is, in modern fiction, the greatest master of antithesis
of mood between scene and scene. His most
emphatic effects are attained, like those of Gothic architecture,
by a juxtaposition of the grotesque and the
sublime. Often, to be sure, he overworks the antithetic;
and entire sections of his narrative move like the walking-beam
of a ferry-boat, tilting now to this side, now to that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
But in spite of his excess in employing this device, his
practice should be studied carefully; for at his best he
illustrates more convincingly than any other author the
effectiveness of emphasis by contrast.</p>
<p>The subtlest way of employing this expedient is to present
an antithesis of mood within a single scene. Dame
Quickly&rsquo;s account of Falstaff&rsquo;s death touches at once the
heights of humor and the depths of pathos. At the
close of &ldquo;Mrs. Bathurst,&rdquo; the tragic narrative is interrupted
by the passage of a picnic-party singing a light
love-song. Shylock, in his great dialogue with Tubal,
is at the same moment plunged in melancholy over the
defection of his daughter and flushed with triumph because
he has Antonio at last within his clutches. Each
emotion seems more potent because it is contrasted with
the other. In Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love-o&rsquo;-Women,&rdquo; the
tragic effect is enhanced by the fact that the tale is told
by the humorous Mulvaney. Thus:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; now?&rsquo; she sez, lookin&rsquo; at him; an&rsquo; the red paint
stud lone on the white av her face like a bull&rsquo;s-eye on a
target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lifted up his eyes, slow an&rsquo; very slow, an&rsquo; he looked
at her long an&rsquo; very long, an&rsquo; he tuk his spache betune his
teeth wid a wrench that shuk him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo;, Aigypt&ndash;&ndash;dyin&rsquo;,&rsquo; he says; ay, those were
his words, for I remimber the name he called her. He
was turnin&rsquo; the death-color, but his eyes niver rowled.
They were set&ndash;&ndash;set on her. Widout word or warnin&rsquo;
she opened her arms full stretch, an&rsquo; &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; she sez.
(Oh, fwhat a golden mericle av a voice ut was.) &lsquo;Die
here,&rsquo; she sez; an&rsquo; Love-o&rsquo;-Women dhropped forward, an&rsquo;
she hild him up, for she was a fine big woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>8. Emphasis by Climax.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Another rhetorical expedient
from which emphasis may be derived is, of course, the
use of climax. The materials of a short-story, or of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
chapter of narrative, should in nearly every case be assembled
in an ascending order of importance,&ndash;&ndash;each incident
carrying the interest to a higher level than that of
the preceding. The same is true of the structure of a
novel from the outset to the moment of the culmination;
but of course it is rarely possible in the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> to
carry the interest any higher than the level it attained
at the point of greatest complication. Climacteric progressiveness
of structure is effectively exhibited in Henry
James&rsquo; tale of mystery and terror, &ldquo;The Turn of the
Screw.&rdquo; The author on horror&rsquo;s head horrors accumulates,
in a steadily ascending scale. But, on the other
hand, many stories have been marred by the introduction
of a very striking scene too early in the structure,
after which there has succeeded of necessity an appreciable
diminution in the interest. The reason why sequels
to great novels have rarely been successful is that it has
been impossible for the author in the second volume
to sustain a climacteric rise of interest from the level
where he left off in the first.</p>
<p><b>9. Emphasis by Surprise.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A means of emphasis less
technical and more psychological than those which have
been hitherto discussed is that which owes its origin to
surprise. Whatever hits the reader unexpectedly will
hit him hard. He will be most impressed by that for
which he has been least prepared. Chapter XXXII
of &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; passes in Brussels during the battle
of Waterloo. The reader is kept in the city with the
women of the story while the men are fighting on the
field a dozen miles away. All day a distant cannonading
rumbles on the ear. At nightfall the noise stops suddenly.
Then, at the end of the chapter, the reader is
told:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more firing was heard at Brussels&ndash;&ndash;the pursuit
rolled miles away. Darkness came down on the field
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
and city: and Amelia was praying for George, who
was lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through his
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement of George Osborne&rsquo;s death is emphasized
in several ways at once. It is made emphatic by
position, since it is placed at the very end of a long chapter;
by inverse proportion, since it is set forth in a single
phrase after many pages that have been devoted to less
important matters; but most of all by the startle of surprise
with which it strikes the reader. Likewise, the
last sentence of de Maupassant&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Necklace,&rdquo;
quoted earlier in this chapter, is emphatic by surprise as
well as by position; and the same is true of the clever and
unexpected close of H. C. Bunner&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Sisterly Scheme,&rdquo;
in many ways a little masterpiece of art.</p>
<p>In tales of mystery, the interest is maintained chiefly
by the deft manipulation of surprise; but even in novels
wherein the aim to mystify is very far from being the
primary purpose of the author, it is often wise to keep a
secret from the reader for the sake of the emphasis by surprise
which may be derived at the moment of revelation.
In &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; the reader is led for a long time
to suppose that the character of Mr. Boffin is changing
for the worse; and his interest is stimulated keenly when
he discovers ultimately that the apparent degeneration
has been only a pretense.</p>
<p>In the drama this expedient must be used with great
delicacy, because a sudden and startling shock of surprise
is likely to scatter the attention of the spectators
and flurry them out of a true conception of the scene. The
reader of a novel, when he discovers with surprise that
he has been skilfully deceived through several pages,
may pause to reconstruct his conception of the narrative,
and may even re-read the entire passage through which
the secret has been withheld from him. But in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
theatre, the spectators cannot stop the play while they
reconstruct in retrospect their judgment of a situation;
and therefore, in the drama, a moment of surprise should
be carefully led up to by anticipatory suggestion. Before
Lady Macbeth is disclosed walking in her sleep, her
doctor and her waiting-gentlewoman are sent on to tell
the audience of her &ldquo;slumbery agitation.&rdquo; This is
excellent art in the theatre; but it would be bad art in the
pages of a novel. In a story written to be read, surprise
is most effective when it is complete.</p>
<p><b>10. Emphasis by Suspense.</b>&ndash;&ndash;An even more interesting
form of emphasis in narrative is emphasis by suspense.
Wilkie Collins is accredited with having said
that the secret of holding the attention of one&rsquo;s readers
lay in the ability to do three things: &ldquo;Make &rsquo;em laugh;
make &rsquo;em weep; make &rsquo;em wait.&rdquo; Still abide these
three; and the greatest is the last. The ability to make
the reader wait, through many pages and at times
through many chapters, is a very valuable asset of the
writer of fiction; but this ability is applied to best advantage
when it is exercised within certain limitations.
In the first place, there is no use in making the reader
wait unless he is first given an inkling of what he is to
wait for. The reader should be tantalized; he should be
made to long for the fruit that is just beyond his grasp;
and he should not be left in ignorance as to the nature of
the fruit, lest he should long for it half-heartedly. A
vague sense of &ldquo;something evermore about to be&rdquo; is not
so interesting to the reader as a vivid sense of the imminence
of some particular occurrence that he wishes ardently
to witness. The expedient of suspense is most
effective when either of two things and only two, both of
which the reader has imagined in advance, is just about
to happen, and the reader, desirous of the one and apprehensive
of the other, is kept waiting while the balance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
trembles. In the second place, there is seldom any use
in making the reader wait unless he is given in the end
the thing he has been waiting for. A short-story may
occasionally set forth a suspense which is never to be
satisfied. Frank R. Stockton&rsquo;s famous tale, &ldquo;The Lady
or the Tiger?&rdquo;, ends with a question which neither the
reader nor the author is able to answer; and Bayard
Taylor&rsquo;s fascinating short-story, &ldquo;Who Was She?&rdquo;, never
reveals the alluring secret of the heroine&rsquo;s identity. But
in an extended story an unsatisfied suspense is often less
emphatic than no suspense at all, because the reader in
the end feels cheated by the author who has made him
wait for nothing. There are, of course, exceptions to this
statement. In &ldquo;The Marble Faun,&rdquo; Hawthorne is undoubtedly
right in never revealing the shape of Donatello&rsquo;s
ears, even though the reader continually expects
the revelation; but, in the same novel, it is difficult
to see what, if anything, is gained by making the reader
wait in vain for the truth about the shadowy past of
Miriam.</p>
<p><b>11. Emphasis by Imitative Movement.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Emphasis
in narrative may also be attained by imitative movement.
Whatever is imagined to have happened quickly
should be narrated quickly, in few words and in rapid
rhythm; and whatever is imagined to have happened
slowly should be narrated in a more leisurely manner,&ndash;&ndash;sometimes
in a greater number of words than are absolutely
necessitated by the sense alone,&ndash;&ndash;the words being
arranged, furthermore, in a rhythm of appreciable sluggishness.
In &ldquo;Markheim,&rdquo; the dealer is murdered in a
single sudden sentence: &ldquo;The long, skewerlike dagger
flashed and fell.&rdquo; But, later on in the story, it takes the
hero a whole paragraph, containing no less than three
hundred words, to mount the four-and-twenty steps to
the first floor of the house. In the following passage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
from &ldquo;The Masque of the Red Death,&rdquo; notice how
much of the effect is due to imitative movement in the
narrative:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad
assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party
there were found none who put forth hand to seize him;
so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the
Prince&rsquo;s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with
one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the
walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the
same solemn and measured step which had distinguished
him from the first, through the blue chamber to the
purple&ndash;&ndash;through the purple to the green&ndash;&ndash;through the
green to the orange&ndash;&ndash;through this again to the white&ndash;&ndash;and
even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had
been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the
Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame
of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly
through the six chambers, while none followed him on
account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all.&rdquo;
The spectre and the Prince pass successively through the
same series of rooms; but it takes the former fifty-one
words to cover the distance, whereas it takes the latter
only six.</p>
<p>In every story that is artistically fashioned, the methods
of emphasis enumerated in this chapter will be found
to be continually applied. Its essential features will be
rendered prominent by position (terminal or initial), by
pause, by proportion (direct or inverse), by iteration or
parallelism, by antithesis, by climax, by surprise, by
suspense, by imitative movement, or by a combination
of any or all of these. The necessity of emphasis is
ever present; the means of emphasis are simple; and
any writer of narrative who knows his art will endeavor
to employ them always to the best advantage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE EPIC, THE DRAMA, AND THE NOVEL</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Fiction a Generic Term&ndash;&ndash;Narrative in Verse and Narrative in
Prose&ndash;&ndash;Three Moods of Fiction: I. The Epic Mood&ndash;&ndash;II. The Dramatic
Mood: 1. Influence of the Actor; 2. Influence of the Theatre;
3. Influence of the Audience&ndash;&ndash;[Dramatized Novels]&ndash;&ndash;III. The
Novelistic Mood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Fiction a Generic Term.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Throughout the present volume,
the word <i>fiction</i> has been used with a very broad
significance, to include every type of literary composition
whose purpose is to embody certain truths of human life
in a series of imagined facts. The reason for this has
been that the same general artistic methods, with very
slight and obvious modifications, are applicable to every
sort of narrative which sets forth imagined people in a
series of imagined acts. Nearly all of the technical
principles which have been outlined in the six preceding
chapters apply not only to the novel and the short-story,
but likewise to the epic and the lesser narrative in verse,
and also (though with certain evident limitations) to
the drama. The materials and methods of fiction may
be studied in the works of Homer, Shakespeare, and even
Browning, as well as in the works of Balzac, Turg&eacute;nieff,
and Mr. Kipling. The nature of narrative is necessarily
the same, whatever be its mood or its medium. The
methods of constructing plots, of delineating characters,
of employing settings, do not differ appreciably whether
a narrative be written in verse or in prose; and in either
case the same selection of point of view and variety
of emphasis are possible. Therefore, in this volume, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
attempt has hitherto been made to distinguish one type
of fictitious narrative from another.</p>
<p><b>Narrative in Verse and Narrative in Prose.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Such a
distinction, if it be attempted at all, should be made only
on the broadest and most general lines. First of all,
it should be admitted that, in an inquiry concerned
solely with the methods of fiction, no technical distinction
is possible between the narrative that is written in verse
and the narrative that is written in prose. The two differ
in the mood of their materials and the medium through
which they are expressed; but they do not differ distinctly
in methods of construction. As far as plot and characters
and setting are concerned, Sir Walter Scott went to work
in the Waverley Novels, which are written in prose, just
as he had gone to work in &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lady
of the Lake,&rdquo; which are written in verse. In his verse
he said things with the better art, in his prose he had more
things to say; but in each case his central purpose was the
same: and nothing can be gained from a critical dictum
that &ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo; is fiction and that &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; is not.
In the history of every nation, fiction has been written
earliest in verse and only afterwards in prose. What we
loosely call the novel was developed late in literature, at a
time after prose had supplanted verse as the natural
medium for narrative. Therefore, and therefore only,
have we come to regard the novel as a type of prose literature.
For there is no inherent reason why a novel may
not be written in verse. There is a sense in which Mrs.
Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aurora Leigh,&rdquo; Owen Meredith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucile,&rdquo;
and Coventry Patmore&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Angel in the House,&rdquo; to
mention works of very different quality and calibre, may
be regarded more properly as novels than as poems. The
story of &ldquo;Maud&rdquo; inspired Tennyson to poetic utterance,
and he told the tale in a series of exquisite lyrics; but the
same story might have been used by a different author as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
the basis for a novel in prose. The subject of &ldquo;Evangeline&rdquo;
was suggested to Longfellow by Hawthorne; and if
the great prose poet had written the story himself, it
would not have differed essentially in material or in structural
method from the narrative as we know it through
the medium of the verse romancer. Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e has
composed admirable short-stories in verse as well as in
prose. &ldquo;The Strike of the Iron-Workers&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>La Gr&eacute;ve des
Forgerons</i>&rdquo;), which is written in rhymed Alexandrines,
does not differ markedly in narrative method from &ldquo;The
Substitute&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Le Rempla&ccedil;ant</i>&rdquo;), which is written in
prose. To be sure, the former is a poem and the latter is
not; but only a very narrow-minded critic would call the
latter a short-story without applying the same term also
to the former. Therefore, the question whether a certain
fictitious tale should be told in verse or in prose has no
place in a general discussion of the materials and methods
of fiction. It is a matter of expression merely, and must
be decided in each case by the temperamental attitude of
the author toward his subject-matter.</p>
<p><b>Three Moods of Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Eliminating, therefore, as
unprofitable any attempt at a critical distinction between
fiction that is written in verse and fiction that is written
in prose, we may yet derive a certain profit from a distinction
along broad and general lines between three leading
moods of fiction,&ndash;&ndash;the epic, the dramatic, and what
(lacking a more precise term) we may call the novelistic.
Certain materials of fiction are inherently epic, or dramatic,
or novelistic, as the case may be. Also, an author,
according to his mental attitude toward life and toward
the subject-matter of his fictions, may cast his stories
either in the epic, the dramatic, or the novelistic mood.
In order to understand this distinction, we must examine
the nature of the epic and the drama, and then study the
novel in comparison with these two elder types of fiction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p><b>I. The Epic Mood.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The great epics of the world,
whether, as in the case of the Norse sagas and possibly
of the Homeric poems, they have been a gradual and
undeliberate aggregation of traditional ballads, or else,
as in the case of the &ldquo;&AElig;neid&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo;
they have been the deliberate production of a single
conscious artist, have attained their chief significance
from the fact that they have summed up within themselves
the entire contribution to human progress of a
certain race, a certain nation, a certain organized religion.
The glory that was Greece is epitomized and sung
forever in the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the grandeur that was Rome,
in the &ldquo;&AElig;neid.&rdquo; All that the Middle Ages gave the
world is gathered and expressed in the &ldquo;Divine Comedy&rdquo;
of Dante: all of medieval history, science, philosophy,
scholarship, poetry, religion may be reconstructed from
a right reading and entire understanding of this single
monumental poem. If you would know Portugal in
her great age of discovery and conquest and national
expansion, read the &ldquo;Lusiads&rdquo; of Camo&euml;ns. If you
would know Christianity militant against the embattled
legions of the Saracens, read the &ldquo;Jerusalem Liberated&rdquo;
of Tasso. If you would know what the Puritan religion
once meant to the greatest minds of England, read the
&ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; of Milton.</p>
<p>The great epics have attained this resumptive and historical
significance only by exhibiting as subject-matter
a vast and communal struggle, in which an entire race,
an entire nation, an entire organized religion has been
concerned,&ndash;&ndash;a struggle imagined as so vast that it has
shaken heaven as well as earth and called to conflict not
only men but also gods. The epic has dealt always with
a struggle, at once human and divine, to establish a great
communal cause. This cause, in the &ldquo;&AElig;neid,&rdquo; is the
founding of Rome; in the &ldquo;Jerusalem Liberated&rdquo; it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; in the &ldquo;Faerie
Queene&rdquo; it is the triumph of the virtues over the vices;
in the &ldquo;Lusiads&rdquo; it is the discovery and conquest of the
Indies; in the &ldquo;Divine Comedy&rdquo; it is the salvation of
the human soul. Whatever nations, whatever races,
whatever gods oppose the founding of Rome or the liberation
of Jerusalem must be conquered, because in either
case the epic cause is righteous and predestined to prevail.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the characters in the great epics are
memorable mainly because of the part that they play in
advancing or retarding the victory of the vast and social
cause which is the subject of the story. Their virtues and
their faults are communal and representative: they are
not adjudged as individuals, apart from the conflict in
which they figure: and, as a consequence, they are rarely
interesting in their individual traits. It is in rendering
the more intimate and personal phases of human character
that epic literature shows itself, when compared with
the modern novel, inefficient. The epic author exhibits
little sympathy for any individual who struggles against
the cause that is to be established. &AElig;neas dallying with
Dido and subsequent desertion of her is of little interest
to Virgil on the ground of individual personality: what
interests him mainly is that so long as &AElig;neas lingers
with the Carthaginian queen, the founding of Rome is
being retarded, and that when at last &AElig;neas leaves her,
he does so to advance the epic cause. Therefore Virgil
regards the desertion of Dido as an act of heroic virtue
on the part of the man who sails away to found a nation.
A modern novelist, however (and this is the main point
to be considered in this connection), would conceive the
whole matter more personally. He would be far less
interested at the moment in the ultimate founding of
Rome than he would be in the misery of the deserted
woman; and instead of considering &AElig;neas as a model of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
heroic virtue, would adjudge him as personally base.
From this we see that the novelistic attitude toward character
is much more intimate than the epic attitude. The
wrath of Achilles is significant to Homer, not so much because
it is an exhibition of individual personality as because
it is a factor in jeopardizing the victory of the
Greeks. Considered as types of individual character,
most of Homer&rsquo;s heroes are mere boys. It is the cause
for which they fight that gives them dignity: embattled
Greece must repossess the beauty which a lesser race has
reft away from it. Even Helen herself is merely an idea
to be fought for; she is not, as a woman, interesting
humanly. It is only in infrequent passages, such as the
scene of parting between Andromache and Hector, that
the ancient epics reveal the intimate attitude toward
character to which we have grown accustomed in the
modern novel.</p>
<p>Because the epic authors have been interested always
in communal conflict rather than in individual personality,
they have seldom made any use of the element of
love,&ndash;&ndash;the most intimate and personal of all emotions.
There is no love in Homer, and scarcely any love in Virgil
and in Milton. Tasso, to be sure, uses a love motive as
the basis for each of the three leading strands of his story;
but because of this, his epic, though gaining in modernity
and charm, loses something of the communal immensity&ndash;&ndash;the
impersonal dignity&ndash;&ndash;of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;&AElig;neid.&rdquo; On the other hand, novelistic authors, since
they have been interested mainly in the revelation of
intimate phases of individual personality, have seized
upon the element of love as the leading motive of their
stories. And this is one of the main differences, on the
side of content, between epic and novelistic fiction.</p>
<p>Certain great works of fiction stand upon the borderland
between the epic and the novel. &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
is, for instance, such a work. It is epic in that it sums
up and expresses the entire contribution of Spain to the
progress of humanity. It is resumptive of the nation
that produced it: all phases of Spanish life and character,
ideals and temperament, are epitomized within it. But,
on the other hand, it is novelistic in the emphasis it casts
on individual personality,&ndash;&ndash;the intimacy with which it
focusses the interest not so much upon a nation as upon
a man.</p>
<p>The epic, in the ancient sense, is dead to-day. Facility
of intercommunication between the nations has made us
all citizens of the world; and an increased sense of the
relativity of national and religious ideals has made us
catholic of other systems than our own. Consequently
we have lost belief in a communal conflict so absolutely
just and necessary as to call to battle powers not only
human but divine. Also, since the French Revolution,
we have grown to set the one above the many, and to believe
that, of right, society exists for the sake of the individual
rather than the individual for the sake of society.
Therefore the novel, which deals with individual personality
in and for itself, is more attuned to modern life than
the epic, which presents the individual mainly in relation
to a communal cause which he strives to advance or to
retard.</p>
<p>The epic note, however, survives in certain momentous
modern novels. &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rdquo; for example, is
less important merely as a novel than as the epic of the
great cause of abolition. Underlying many of the works
of Erckmann-Chatrian is an epic purpose to advance the
cause of universal peace by a depiction of the horrors of
war. Balzac had in mind the resumptive phase of epic
composition when he planned his &ldquo;Human Comedy&rdquo;
(choosing his title in evident imitation of that of Dante&rsquo;s
poem), and started out to sum up all phases of human life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
in a single monumental series of narratives. So also the
late Frank Norris had an epic idea in his imagination
when he planned a trilogy of novels (which unhappily
he died before completing) to exhibit what the great wheat
industry means to the modern world.</p>
<p>In the broad and social sense, the epic is undeniably
a greater type of fiction than the novel, because it is more
resumptive of life in the large, and looks upon humanity
with a vaster sweep of vision; but in the deep and personal
sense, the novel is the greater, because it is more
capable of an intimate study of individual emotion. And
it is possible, as we have seen, that modern fiction should
be at once epic and novelistic in content and in mood,&ndash;&ndash;epic
in resuming all aspects of a certain phase of life and
in exhibiting a social struggle, and novelistic in casting
emphasis upon personal details of character and in depicting
intimate emotions. Probably no other author has
succeeded better than Emile Zola in combining the epic
and the novelistic moods of fiction; and the novels in the
Rougon-Macquart series are at once communal and personal
in their significance.</p>
<p><b>II. The Dramatic Mood.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is somewhat simpler to
trace a distinction both in content and in method between
novelistic and dramatic fiction, because the latter
is produced under special conditions which impose definite
limitations upon the author. A drama is, in essence,
a story devised to be presented by actors on a
stage before an audience. The dramatist, therefore,
works ever under the sway of three influences to which
the novelist is not submitted:&ndash;&ndash;namely, the temperament
of the actors by whom his plays are to be performed,
the physical conditions of the theatre in which they are to
be produced, and the psychologic nature of the audience
before which they are to be presented. The combined
force of these three external influences upon the dramatist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
accounts for all of the essential differences between the
drama and the novel.</p>
<p><b>1. Influence of the Actor.</b>&ndash;&ndash;First of all, because of the
influence of his actors, the dramatist is obliged to draw
character through action, and to eliminate from his work
almost every other means of characterization. He must
therefore select from life such moments as are active
rather than passive. His characters must constantly
be doing something; they may not pause for careful
contemplation. Consequently the novelist has a wider
range of subject than the dramatist, because he is able to
consider life more calmly, and to concern himself, if need
be, with thoughts and feelings that do not translate themselves
into action. In depicting objective events in
which the element of action is paramount, the drama is
more immediate and vivid; but the novel may depict
subjective events which are quite beyond the presentation
of actors in a theatre. Furthermore, since he is
not obliged to think of actors, the novelist has a greater
freedom in creating characters than the dramatist. The
great characters of the drama have been devised by playwrights
who have already attained command of the
theatre of their place and time, and who therefore have
fashioned their parts to fit the individual actors they have
found ready to perform them. Consequently they have
endowed their characters with the physical, and even to
some extent the mental, characteristics of certain actual
actors. M. Rostand&rsquo;s Cyrano de Bergerac is not merely
Cyrano, but also Constant Coquelin; Sardou&rsquo;s La Tosca
is not merely La Tosca, but also Mme. Sarah Bernhardt;
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne is not merely C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne, but also Mlle.
Moli&egrave;re; Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet is not merely Hamlet, but
also Richard Burbage. In working thus with one eye
upon the actual, the dramatist is extremely likely to be
betrayed into untruthfulness. In the last scene of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
&ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; the Queen says of the Prince, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fat and
scant of breath.&rdquo; This line was of course occasioned by
the fact that Richard Burbage was corpulent during the
season of 1602. But the eternal truth is that Prince
Hamlet is a slender man; and Shakespeare has here been
forced to belie the truth in order to subserve the fact.
On the other hand, the dramatist is undoubtedly aided
in his great aim of creating characters by holding in mind
certain actual people who have been selected to represent
them; and what the novelist gains in range and freedom
of characterization, he is likely to lose in concreteness of
delineation.</p>
<p><b>2. Influence of the Theatre.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Secondly, the form and
structure of the drama in any age is imposed upon the
dramatist by the size and shape and physical appointments
of the theatre he is writing for. Plays must be
built in one way to fit the theatre of Dionysus, in another
way to fit the Globe upon the Bankside, in still another
way to fit the modern electric-lighted stage behind a picture-frame
proscenium. The dramatist in constructing
his story is hedged in by a multitude of physical restrictions,
of which he must make a special study in order to
force them to contribute to the presentation of his truth
instead of detracting from it. In this regard, again, the
novelist works with greater freedom. Seldom is his
labor subjected to merely physical restrictions from
without. Sometimes, to be sure, certain arbitrary conditions
of the trade of publishing have exercised an influence
over the structure of the novel. In England, early
in the nineteenth century, it was easier to sell a three-volume
novel than a tale of lesser compass; and many a
story of the time had to be pieced out beyond its natural
and truthful length in order to meet the demands of the
public and the publishers. But such a case, in the history
of the novel, is exceptional. In general, the novelist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
may build as he chooses. He may tell a tale, long or
short, happening in few places or in many; and is not, like
the modern dramatist, confined in place to no more
than four or five different settings, and in time to the
two hours&rsquo; traffic of the stage. The novel, therefore,
is far more serviceable than the drama as a medium for
exhibiting the gradual growth of character,&ndash;&ndash;the development
of personality under influences extending over long
periods of time and exerted in many different places.</p>
<p><b>3. Influence of the Audience.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Thirdly, the very content
of the drama is determined by the fact that a play
must be devised to interest a multitude rather than an
individual. The novelist writes for a reader sitting alone
in his library: whether ten such readers or a hundred
thousand ultimately read a book, the author speaks to
each of them apart from all the others. But the dramatist
must plan his story to interest simultaneously a
multitude of heterogeneous observers. The drama,
therefore, must be richer in popular appeal; but the
novel may be subtler in appealing to the one instead of
to the many. Since the novelist addresses himself to a
single person only, or to a limitless succession of single
persons, he may choose the sort of reader he will write
for; but the dramatist must please the many, and is
therefore at the mercy of the multitude. He writes less
freely than the novelist, since he cannot pick his auditors.
His themes, his thoughts, and his emotions are restricted
by the limits of popular appreciation.</p>
<p>This important condition is potent in determining the
proper content of dramatic fiction. For it has been
found in practice that the one thing most likely to interest
a crowd is a struggle between character and character.
Speaking empirically, the late Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re,
in his preface to &ldquo;<i>Annales du Th&eacute;&acirc;tre et de la Musique</i>&rdquo;
for 1893, stated that the drama has dealt always with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
struggle between human wills; and his statement, formulated
in the catch-phrase, &ldquo;No struggle, no drama,&rdquo;
has since become a commonplace of dramatic criticism.
The reason for this is simply that characters are interesting
to a crowd mainly in those crises of emotion that bring
them to the grapple. A single individual, like the reader
of a novel, may be interested intellectually in those gentle
influences beneath which a character unfolds itself as
mildly as a blowing rose; but to the gathered multitude a
character does not appeal except in moments of contention.
Hence the drama, to interest an audience, must
present its characters in some struggle of the wills,&ndash;&ndash;whether
it be merely flippant, as in the case of Benedick
and Beatrice, or gentle, as in that of Viola and Orsino,
or terrible, with Macbeth, or piteous, with Lear. The
drama, therefore, is akin to the epic, in that it must
represent a struggle; but it is more akin to the novel, in
that it deals with human character in its individual,
rather than its communal, aspects. But in range of
representing characters, the drama is more restricted
than the novel; for though the novelist is at liberty to
exhibit a struggle of individual human wills whenever he
may choose to do so, he is not, like the dramatist, prohibited
from representing anything else. In covering
this special province, the drama is undeniably more vivid
and emphatic; but many momentous phases of human
experience are not contentious but contemplative; and
these the novel may reveal serenely, without employment
of the sound and fury of the drama.</p>
<p>Since the mind of the multitude is more emotional than
intellectual, the dramatist, for his most effective moments,
is obliged to set forth action with emotion for
its motive. But the novelist, in motivating action, may
be more considerate and intellectual, since his appeal
is made to the individual mind. In its psychologic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
processes, the crowd is more commonplace and more
traditional than is the individual. The drama, therefore,
is less serviceable than the novel as a vehicle for
conveying unaccustomed and advanced ideas of life.
The crowd has no speculation in its eyes: it is impatient
of original thought, and of any but inherited emotion:
it evinces little favor for the original, the questioning,
the new. Therefore if an author holds ideas of religion,
or of politics, or of social law that are in advance of his
time, he will do better to embody them in a novel than
in a drama; because the former makes its appeal to the
individual mind, which has more patience for intellectual
consideration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the novelist need not, like the dramatist,
subserve the immediate necessity for popular appeal.
The dramatic author, since he plans his story for a heterogeneous
multitude of people, must incorporate in the
same single work of art elements that will interest all
classes of mankind. But the novelistic author, since he
is at liberty to pick his auditors at will, may, if he choose,
write only for the best-developed minds. It is an element
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s greatness that his most momentous
plays, like &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; are of interest to
people who can neither read nor write, as well as to people
of educated sensibilities. But it is an evidence of Meredith&rsquo;s
greatness that his novels are caviare to the general.
Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;They&rdquo; is the greater story because it defends
itself from being understood by those it is not really
for. In exhibiting the subtler and more delicate phases
of human experience, the novel far transcends the drama.
The drama, at its deepest, is more poignant; but the
novel, at its highest, is more exquisite.</p>
<p><b>Dramatized Novels.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The proper material for the
drama is, as we have seen, a struggle between individual
human wills, motivated by emotion rather than by intellect,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
and expressed in terms of objective action. In
representing such material, the drama is supreme. But
the novel is wider in range; for besides exhibiting (though
less emphatically) this special aspect of human life, it
may embody many other and scarcely less important
phases of individual experience. Of late, an effort has
been made to break down the barrier between the novel
and the drama: many stories, which have been told first
in the novelistic mood, have afterward been reconstructed
and retold for presentation in the theatre. This
attempt has succeeded sometimes, but has more often
failed. Yet it ought to be very easy to distinguish a
novel that may be dramatized from a novel that may not.
Certain scenes in novelistic literature, like the duel in
&ldquo;The Master of Ballantrae,&rdquo; are essentially dramatic
both in content and in mood. Such scenes may be
adapted with very little labor to the uses of the theatre.
Certain novels, like &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; which exhibit an emphatic
struggle between individual human wills, are
inherently capable of theatric representment. But any
novel in which the main source of interest is not the clash
of character on character, in which the element of action
is subordinate, or in which the chief appeal is made to the
individual (instead of the collective) mind, is not capable
of being dramatized successfully.</p>
<p><b>III. The Novelistic Mood.</b>&ndash;&ndash;It is impossible to determine
whether, at the present day, the novel or the drama
is the more effective medium for embodying the truths
of human life in a series of imagined facts. Dramatic
fiction has the greater depth, and novelistic fiction has
the greater breadth. The latter is more extensive, the
former more intensive, in its artistry. This much, however,
may be decided definitely. The novel, at its greatest,
may require a vaster sweep of wisdom on the part
of the author; but the drama is technically more difficult,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
since the dramatist, besides mastering all of the general
methods of fiction which he necessarily employs in common
with the novelist, must labor in conformity with a
special set of conditions to which the novelist is not submitted.
George Meredith may be a greater author than
Sir Arthur Wing Pinero; but Pinero is of necessity more
rigid in his mastery of structure.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Novel, Novelette, and Short-Story.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Turning our attention
from the epic and the drama, and confining it to
the general type of fiction which in the last chapter
was loosely named novelistic, we shall find it possible to
distinguish somewhat sharply, on the basis of both material
and method, between three several forms,&ndash;&ndash;the
novel, the novelette, and the short-story. The French,
who are more precise than we in their use of denotative
terms, are accustomed to divide their novelistic fiction
into what they call the <i>roman</i>, the <i>nouvelle</i>, and the <i>conte</i>.
&ldquo;Novel&rdquo; and &ldquo;novelette&rdquo; are just as serviceable terms
as <i>roman</i> and <i>nouvelle</i>; in fact, since &ldquo;novelette&rdquo; is the
diminutive of &ldquo;novel,&rdquo; they express even more clearly
than their French equivalents the relation between the
two forms they designate. But it is greatly to be regretted
that we do not have in English a distinctive word
that is the equivalent of <i>conte</i>. Edgar Allan Poe used
the word &ldquo;tale&rdquo; with similar meaning; but this term is so
indefinite and vague that it has been discarded by later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
critics. It is customary at the present day to use the
word &ldquo;short-story,&rdquo; which Professor Brander Matthews
has suggested spelling with a hyphen to indicate that it
has a special and technical significance.</p>
<p>The French apply the term <i>roman</i> to extensive works
like &ldquo;Notre Dame de Paris&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eug&eacute;nie Grandet&rdquo;;
and they apply the term <i>nouvelle</i> to works of briefer compass
but similar method, like the &ldquo;Colomba&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Carmen&rdquo; of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. In English we may
class as novels works like &ldquo;Kenilworth,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Newcomes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Last of the Mohicans,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rise of Silas
Lapham&rdquo;; and we may class as novelettes works like
&ldquo;Daisy Miller,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Treasure of Franchard,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Light That Failed.&rdquo; The difference is merely that the
novelette (or <i>nouvelle</i>) is a work of less extent, and covers
a smaller canvas, than the novel (or <i>roman</i>). The distinction
is quantitative but not qualitative. The novelette
deals with fewer characters and incidents than the
novel; it usually limits itself to a stricter economy of time
and place; it presents a less extensive view of life, with
(most frequently) a more intensive art. But these differences
are not definite enough to warrant its being considered
a species distinct from the novel. Except for the
restrictions imposed by brevity of compass, the writer of
novelettes employs the same methods as the writer of
novels; and, furthermore, he sets forth similar materials.</p>
<p><b>The Novel and the Novelette.</b>&ndash;&ndash;More and more in
recent years, the novel has tended to shorten to the
novelette. A stricter sense of art has led to the exclusion
of digressive and discursive passages; and the hurry
and preoccupation of contemporary readers has militated
against the leisurely and rambling habit of the authors
of an earlier time. The lesson of excision and condensation
has been taught by writers as different in tone as
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, Turg&eacute;nieff, and Stevenson. &ldquo;The three-volume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
novel is extinct,&rdquo; as Mr. Kipling stated in the
motto prefixed to the poem called &ldquo;The Three-Decker,&rdquo;
in which, with a commingling of satire and sentiment, he
chanted its requiem. It was nearly always, in the matter
of structure, a slovenly form; and there is therefore
little cause for regret that the novelette seems destined
to supplant it. For the novelette accomplishes the
same purpose as the novel, with necessarily a more intensive
emphasis of art, and with a tax considerably less
upon the time and attention of the reader.</p>
<p><b>The Short-Story a Distinct Type.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But the <i>conte</i>, or
short-story, differs from the novel and the novelette
not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively, not only
in length, but also in kind. In such <i>contes</i> as &ldquo;The
Necklace&rdquo; of de Maupassant and &ldquo;The Last Class&rdquo;
of Daudet, in such short-stories as &ldquo;Ligeia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ambitious
Guest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Markheim,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Without Benefit of
Clergy,&rdquo; the aim of the author is quite distinct from that
of the writer of novels and of novelettes. In material and
in method, as well as in extent, these stories represent
a type that is noticeably different.</p>
<p>The short-story, as well as the novel and the novelette,
has always existed. The parable of &ldquo;The Prodigal Son,&rdquo;
in the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel according to Luke,
is just as surely a short-story in material and method as
the books of &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Esther&rdquo; are novelettes in
form. But the critical consciousness of the short-story
as a species of fiction distinct in purpose and in method
from the novel dates only from the nineteenth century.
It was Edgar Allan Poe who first designated and realized
the short-story as a distinct form of literary art. In the
scholarly and thorough introduction to his collection of
&ldquo;American Short Stories,&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Professor Charles Sears
Baldwin points out that Poe, more than any of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
predecessors in the art of fiction, felt narrative as structure.
It was he who first rejected from the tale everything that
was, from the standpoint of narrative form, extraneous,
and made the narrative progress more direct. The essential
features of his structure were (to use Professor
Baldwin&rsquo;s words) harmonization, simplification, and gradation.
He stripped his stories of every least incongruity.
What he taught by his example was reduction to a straight
predetermined course; and he made clear to succeeding
writers the necessity of striving for unity of impression
through strict unity of form.</p>
<p><b>The Dictum of Poe.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Poe was a critic as well as a teller
of tales; and what he inculcated by example he also
stated by precept. In his now famous review of Hawthorne&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tales,&rdquo; published originally in <i>Graham&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for May, 1842, he thus outlined his theory of
the species:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ordinary novel is objectionable, from its length,
for reasons already stated in substance. As it cannot be
read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of course, of the immense
force derivable from <i>totality</i>. Worldly interests
intervening during the pauses of perusal, modify, annul,
or counteract, in a greater or less degree, the impressions
of the book. But simple cessation in reading would, of
itself, be sufficient to destroy the true unity. In the brief
tale, however, the author is enabled to carry out the fulness
of his intention, be it what it may. During the hour
of perusal the soul of the reader is at the writer&rsquo;s control.
There are no external or extrinsic influences&ndash;&ndash;resulting
from weariness or interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If
wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate
his incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care,
a certain unique or single <i>effect</i> to be wrought out, he
then invents such incidents&ndash;&ndash;he then combines such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived
effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the
outbringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first
step. In the whole composition there should be no word
written, of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not
to the one pre&euml;stablished design. And by such means,
with such care and skill, a picture is at length painted
which leaves in the mind of him who contemplates it
with a kindred art, a sense of the fullest satisfaction.
The idea of the tale has been presented unblemished,
because undisturbed; and this is an end unattainable
by the novel. Undue brevity is just as exceptionable
here as in the poem; but undue length is yet more to be
avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Formula of Brander Matthews.</b>&ndash;&ndash;From the very
outset, the currency of Poe&rsquo;s short-stories was international;
and his concrete example in striving for totality
of impression exerted an immediate influence not only
in America but even more in France. But his abstract
theory, which (for obvious reasons) did not become so
widely known, was not received into the general body of
critical thought until much later in the century. It remained
for Professor Brander Matthews, in his well-known
essay on &ldquo;The Philosophy of the Short-story,&rdquo;
printed originally in <i>Lippincott&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for October,
1885,<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> to state explicitly what had lain implicit in the
passage of Poe&rsquo;s criticism already quoted, and to give a
general currency to the theory that the short-story differs
from the novel essentially,&ndash;&ndash;and not merely in the matter
of length. In the second section of his essay, Professor
Matthews stated:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A true short-story is something other and something
more than a mere story which is short. A true
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
short-story differs from the novel chiefly in its essential unity of
impression. In a far more exact and precise use of the
word, a short-story has unity as a novel cannot have it.
Often, it may be noted by the way, the short-story fulfills
the three false unities of the French classic drama: it
shows one action, in one place, on one day. A short-story
deals with a single character, a single event, a single
emotion, or the series of emotions called forth by a single
situation. Poe&rsquo;s paradox that a poem cannot greatly
exceed a hundred lines in length under penalty of ceasing
to be one poem and breaking into a string of poems, may
serve to suggest the precise difference between the short-story
and the novel. The short-story is the single effect,
complete and self-contained, while the novel is of necessity
broken into a series of episodes. Thus the short-story
has, what the novel cannot have, the effect of
&lsquo;totality,&rsquo; as Poe called it, the unity of impression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a truth, the short-story is not only not a chapter
out of a novel, or an incident or an episode extracted
from a longer tale, but at its best it impresses the reader
with the belief that it would be spoiled if it were made
larger, or if it were incorporated into a more elaborate
work....</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, it may be said that no one has ever succeeded
as a writer of short-stories who had not ingenuity, originality,
and compression; and that most of those who have
succeeded in this line had also the touch of fantasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Definition of the Short-Story.</b>&ndash;&ndash;On the basis of these
theories, the present writer essayed a few years ago to
formulate within a single sentence a definition of the
short-story. Thus: <i>The aim of a short-story is to produce
a single narrative effect with the greatest economy
of means that is consistent with the utmost emphasis.</i><a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p><b>Explanation of This Definition: 1. &ldquo;Single Narrative
Effect.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;Because of its succinctness, this sentence needs
a little explanation. A narrative effect necessarily involves
the three elements of action, characters, and setting.
In aiming to produce a narrative effect, the short-story,
therefore, differs from the sketch, which may concern
itself with only one of these elements, without involving
the other two. The sketch most often deals with
character or setting divested of the element of action;
but in the short-story something has to happen. In this
regard, the short-story is related more closely to the novel
than to the sketch. But although in the novel any two,
or all three, of the narrative elements may be so intimately
interrelated that no one of them stands out clearly
from the others, it is almost always customary in the
short-story to cast a marked preponderance of emphasis
on one of the elements, to the subversion of the other two.
Short-stories, therefore, may be divided into three classes,
according as the effect which they purpose to produce
is primarily an effect of action, or of character, or of
setting. &ldquo;The Masque of the Red Death&rdquo; produces an
effect of setting, &ldquo;The Tell-Tale Heart&rdquo; an effect of character,
and &ldquo;The Cask of Amontillado&rdquo; an effect of action.
For the sake of economy it is incumbent on the author to
suggest at the outset which of the three sorts of narrative
effect the story is intended to produce. The way in
which Poe accomplished this in the three stories just
mentioned may be seen at once upon examination of the
opening paragraph of each. Having selected his effect
the author of a short-story should confine his attention
to producing that, and that alone. He should stop at
the very moment when his pre&euml;stablished design has
been attained; and never during the progress of his composition
should he turn aside for the sake of a lesser effect
not absolutely inherent in his single narrative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
purpose. Stevenson insisted on this focus of attention in
a passage of a personal letter addressed to Sir Sidney
Colvin:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make another end to it? Ah, yes, but that&rsquo;s not
the way I write; the whole tale is implied; I never use an
effect when I can help it, unless it prepares the effects
that are to follow; that&rsquo;s what a story consists in. To
make another end, that is to make the beginning all
wrong. The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of a long story is nothing, it is
just &lsquo;a full close,&rsquo; which you may approach and accomplish
as you please&ndash;&ndash;it is a coda, not an essential member
in the rhythm; but the body and end of a short-story is
bone of the bone and blood of the blood of the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>2. &ldquo;Greatest Economy of Means&rdquo;; and 3. &ldquo;Utmost
Emphasis.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;The phrase &ldquo;single narrative effect,&rdquo; with
all its implications, should now be clear. The phrase
&ldquo;with the greatest economy of means&rdquo; implies that the
writer of a short-story should tell his tale with the fewest
necessary number of characters and incidents, and
should project it in the narrowest possible range of place
and time. If he can get along with two characters, he
should not use three. If a single event will suffice for his
effect, he should confine himself to that. If his story
can pass in one place at one time, he must not disperse
it over several times and places. But in striving always
for the greatest possible conciseness, he must not neglect
the equally important need of producing his effect &ldquo;with
the utmost emphasis.&rdquo; If he can gain markedly in emphasis
by violating the strictest possible economy, he should
do so; for, as Poe stated, undue brevity is exceptionable,
as well as undue length. Thus the parable of &ldquo;The
Prodigal Son,&rdquo; which might be told with only two characters&ndash;&ndash;the
father and the prodigal&ndash;&ndash;gains sufficiently
in emphasis by the introduction of a third&ndash;&ndash;the good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
son&ndash;&ndash;to warrant this violation of economy. The greatest
structural problem of the writer of short-stories is to strike
just the proper balance between the effort for economy
of means&ndash;&ndash;which tends to conciseness&ndash;&ndash;and the effort for
the utmost emphasis&ndash;&ndash;which tends to amplitude of
treatment.</p>
<p><b>Brief Tales That Are Not Short-Stories.</b>&ndash;&ndash;There can be
no doubt that the short-story, thus rigidly defined, exists
as a distinct form of fiction,&ndash;&ndash;a definite literary species
obeying laws of its own. Now and again before the
nineteenth century, it appeared unconsciously. Since
Poe, it has grown conscious of itself, and has been deliberately
developed to perfection by later masters, like
Guy de Maupassant. But it must be admitted frankly
that brief tales have always existed, and still continue to
exist, which stand entirely outside the scope of this rigid
and rather narrow definition. Professor Baldwin, after
a careful examination of the hundred tales in Boccaccio&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Decameron,&rdquo; concluded that only two of them were
short-stories in the modern critical sense,<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> and that only
three others approached the totality of impression that
depends on conscious unity of form. If we should select
at random a hundred brief tales from the best contemporary
magazines, we should find, of course, that a larger
proportion of them would fulfill the definition; but it is
almost certain that the majority of them would still be
stories that merely happen to be short, instead of true
short-stories in the modern critical sense. Yet these
brief fictions, which are not short-stories, and for which
we have no name, are none the less estimable in content,
and sometimes present a wider view of life than could be
encompassed within the rigid limits of a technical short-story.
Hawthorne&rsquo;s tales stand higher in the history of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
literature than Poe&rsquo;s, because they reveal a deeper insight
into life, even though the great New England dreamer
often violates the principle of economy of means, and constructs
less firmly than the mathematically-minded Poe.
Washington Irving&rsquo;s brief tales, such as &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&rdquo; which are not
short-stories in the technical sense of the term, are far
more valuable as representations of humanity than many
a structural masterpiece of Guy de Maupassant. &ldquo;For
my part,&rdquo; Irving wrote to one of his friends, &ldquo;I consider
a story merely as a frame on which to stretch the materials;
it is the play of thought, and sentiment, and language,
the weaving in of characters, lightly yet expressively
delineated; the familiar and faithful exhibition of scenes
in common life; and the half-concealed vein of humor
that is often playing through the whole,&ndash;&ndash;these are
among what I aim at, and upon which I felicitate myself
in proportion as I think I succeed.&rdquo; There is much to
be said in favor of this meandering and leisurely method;
and authors too intent upon a merely technical accomplishment
may lose the genial breadth of outlook upon
life which men like Irving have so charmingly displayed.
Let us admit, therefore, that the story-which-is-merely-short
is just as worthy of cultivation as the technical
short-story.</p>
<p><b>Short-Stories That Are Not Brief.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But if there exist
many brief tales which are not short-stories, so also there
exist certain short-stories which are not brief. &ldquo;The
Turn of the Screw,&rdquo; by Henry James, is a short-story, in
the technical sense of the term, although it contains
between two and three hundred pages. Assuredly it is
not a novelette. It aims to produce one narrative effect,
and only one; and it is difficult to imagine how the full
force of its cumulative mystery and terror could have
been created with greater economy of means. It is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
long short-story. Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde,&rdquo; which is conceived, and for the most part executed,
as a short-story, is longer than the same author&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Beach of Fales&aacute;,&rdquo; which is conceived and executed
as a novelette. Edward Everett Hale&rsquo;s famous short-story,
&ldquo;The Man Without a Country,&rdquo; is long enough to
be printed in a little volume by itself. The point to be
remembered, therefore, is that the two different types of
brief fiction are to be distinguished one from the other not
by comparative length but by structural method. The
critic may formulate the technical laws of the stricter
type; but it must not be forgotten that these laws do not
apply (and there is no reason whatever that they should)
to those other estimable narratives which, though brief,
stand outside the definition of the short-story.</p>
<p><b>Bliss Perry&rsquo;s Annotations.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Bearing in mind this
limitation of the subject, we may proceed to a further
study of the strict short-story type. In an admirable
essay on &ldquo;The Short Story,&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> Professor Bliss Perry
had discussed at length its requirements and restrictions.
Admitting that writers of short-stories usually cast a
marked preponderance of emphasis on one of the three
elements of narrative, to the subversion of the other two,
Professor Perry calls attention to the fact that in the
short-story of character, &ldquo;the characters must be unique,
original enough to catch the eye at once.&rdquo; The writer
does not have sufficient time at his disposal to reveal
the full human significance of the commonplace. &ldquo;If
his theme is character-development, then that development
must be hastened by striking experiences.&rdquo; Hence
this class of short-story, as compared with the novel,
must set forth characters more unusual and unexpected.
But in the short-story of action, on the other hand, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
plot may be sufficient unto itself, and the characters may
be the merest lay figures. The heroine of &ldquo;The Lady
or the Tiger,&rdquo; for example, is simply <i>a</i> woman&ndash;&ndash;not any
woman in particular; and the hero of &ldquo;The Pit and the
Pendulum&rdquo; is simply <i>a</i> man&ndash;&ndash;not any man in particular.
The situation itself is sufficient to hold the reader&rsquo;s interest
for the brief space of the story. Hence, although, in
the short-story of character, the leading actor is likely to
be strikingly individualized, the short-story of action may
content itself with entirely colorless characters, devoid
of any personal traits whatever. Professor Perry adds
that in the class of short-story which casts the main
emphasis on setting, &ldquo;both characters and action may be
almost without significance&rdquo;; and he continues,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If
the author can discover to us a new corner of the world,
or sketch the familiar scene to our heart&rsquo;s desire, or
illumine one of the great human occupations, as war,
or commerce, or industry, he has it in his power,
through this means alone, to give us the fullest satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the fact that the short-story does not keep the
powers of the reader long upon the stretch, Professor
Perry deduces certain opportunities afforded to short-story
writers but denied to novelists,&ndash;&ndash;opportunities,
namely, &ldquo;for innocent didacticism, for posing problems
without answering them, for stating arbitrary premises,
for omitting unlovely details and, conversely, for making
beauty out of the horrible, and finally for poetic symbolism.&rdquo;
Passing on to a consideration of the demands
which the short-story makes upon the writer, he asserts
that, at its best, &ldquo;it calls for visual imagination of a high
order: the power to see the object; to penetrate to its
essential nature; to select the one characteristic trait by
which it may be represented.&rdquo; Furthermore, it demands
a mastery of style, &ldquo;the verbal magic that recreates for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
us what the imagination has seen.&rdquo; But, on the other
hand, &ldquo;to write a short-story requires no sustained power
of imagination&rdquo;; &ldquo;nor does the short-story demand of its
author essential sanity, breadth, and tolerance of view.&rdquo;
Since he deals only with fleeting phases of existence&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;not
with wholes, but with fragments&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the writer of
the short-story &ldquo;need not be consistent; he need not think
things through.&rdquo; Hence, in spite of the technical difficulties
which beset the author of short-stories, his work
is, on human grounds, more easy than that of the novelist,
who must be sane and consistent, and must be able
to sustain a prolonged effort of interpretive imagination.</p>
<p><b>The Novelist and the Writer of Short-Stories.</b>&ndash;&ndash;These
points have been so fully covered and so admirably illustrated
by Professor Perry that they do not call for any
further discussion in this place. But perhaps something
may be added concerning the different equipments that
are required by authors of novels and authors of short-stories.
Matthew Arnold, in a well-known sonnet, spoke
of Sophocles as a man &ldquo;who saw life steadily and saw it
whole&rdquo;; and if we judge the novelist and the writer of
short-stories by their attitudes toward life, we may say
that they divide this verse between them. Balzac,
George Eliot, and Meredith look at life in the large;
they try to &ldquo;see it whole&rdquo; and to reproduce the chaos
of its intricate relations: but Poe, de Maupassant, and
Mr. Kipling aim rather to &ldquo;see steadily&rdquo; a limited phase
of life, to focus their minds upon a single point of experience,
and then to depict this point briefly and strikingly.
It follows that the novelist requires an experience of life
far more extensive than that which is required by the
writer of short-stories. The great novelists have all been
men of mature years and accumulated wisdom. But if
an author knows one little point of life profoundly, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
may fashion a great short-story, even though that one
thing be the only thing he knows. Of life as it is actually
lived, of genuine humanity of character, of moral responsibility
in human intercourse, Edgar Allan Poe knew
nothing; and yet he was fully equipped to produce what
remain until this day the most perfect examples of the
short-story in our language. It is therefore not surprising
that, although the great novels of the world have
been written for the most part by men over forty years
of age, the great short-stories have been written by men
in their twenties and their thirties. Mr. Kipling wrote
two or three short-stories which are almost great when he
was only seventeen. Steadiness of vision is a quality of
mind quite distinct from the ability to see things whole.
&ldquo;Plain Tales from the Hills&rdquo; are in many ways the better
stories for being the work of a lad of twenty: whatever
Mr. Kipling saw at that very early age he envisaged
steadily and expressed with the glorious triumphant
strength of youth. But if at the same period he had
attempted a novel, the world undoubtedly would have
found out how very young he was. He would have been
incapable of slicing a cross-section clean through the
vastitude of human life, of seeing it whole, and of representing
the appalling intricacy of its interrelations. On
the other hand, most of the mature men who have been
wise enough to do the latter, have shown themselves
incapable of focussing their minds steadily upon a single
point of experience. Wholeness and steadiness of vision&ndash;&ndash;few
are the men who, like Sophocles, have possessed
them both. The same author, therefore, has almost
never been able to write great short-stories and great
novels. Scott wrote only one short-story,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Wandering
Willie&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; in &ldquo;Redgauntlet&rdquo;; Dickens also wrote
only one that is worthy of being considered a masterpiece
of art,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;A Child&rsquo;s Dream of a Star&rdquo;; and Thackeray,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Cooper, George Eliot, and Meredith have written
none at all. On the other hand, Poe could not possibly
have written a novel; Guy de Maupassant shows himself
less masterly in his more extended works; and Mr. Kipling
has yet to prove that the novel is within his powers.
Hawthorne is the one most notable example of the man
who, beginning as a writer of short-stories, has developed
in maturer years a mastery of the novel.</p>
<p><b>The Short-Story More Artistic Than the Novel.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Unlike
the short-story, the novel aims to produce a series of
effects,&ndash;&ndash;a cumulative combination of the elements of
narrative,&ndash;&ndash;and acknowledges no restriction to economy
of means. It follows that the novel, as a literary form,
requires far less attention than the short-story to minute
details of art. Great novels may be written by authors
as careless as Scott, as lazy as Thackeray, or as cumbersome
as George Eliot; for if a novelist gives us a criticism
of life which is new and true, we forgive him if he fails in
the nicer points of structure and style. But without
these nicer points, the short-story is impossible. The
economy of means that it demands can be conserved
only by rigid restriction of structure; and the necessary
emphasis can be produced only by perfection of style.
The great masters of the short-story, like Poe and Hawthorne,
Daudet and de Maupassant, have all been careful
artists: they have not, like Thackeray, been slovenly in
structure; they have not, like Scott, been regardless of
style. The artistic instinct shows itself almost always at
a very early age. If a man is destined to be an artist, he
usually exhibits a surprising precocity of expression at a
period when as yet he has very little to express. This is
another reason why the short-story, as opposed to the
novel, belongs to youth rather than to age. Though a
young writer may be obliged to acknowledge inferiority
to his elders in maturity of message, he may not infrequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
transcend them in fineness of technical accomplishment.</p>
<p><b>The Short-Story Almost Necessarily Romantic.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Another
point that remains to be considered, before we
relinquish this general discussion in order to devote our
attention more particularly to a technical study of the
structure of the short-story, is that, although the novel
may be either realistic or romantic in general method, the
short-story is almost of necessity obliged to be romantic.
In the brief space allotted to him, it is practically impossible
for the writer of short-stories to induce a general
truth from particular imagined facts imitated from
actuality: it is far simpler to deduce the imagined details
of the story from a central thesis, held securely in the
author&rsquo;s mind and suggested to the reader at the outset.
It is a quicker process to think from the truth to facts
than to think from facts to the truth. Daudet and de
Maupassant, who worked realistically in their novels,
worked romantically in their <i>contes</i>; and the great short-stories
of our own language have nearly all been written
by romantic authors, like Poe, Hawthorne, Stevenson,
and Mr. Kipling.</p>

<h3>THE STRUCTURE OF THE SHORT-STORY</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Only One Best Way to Construct a Short-Story&ndash;&ndash;Problems of Short-Story
Construction&ndash;&ndash;The Initial Position&ndash;&ndash;The Terminal Position&ndash;&ndash;Poe&rsquo;s

of &ldquo;The Prodigal Son&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Style Essential to the Short-Story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Only One Best Way to Construct a Short-Story.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Since
the aim of a short-story is to produce a single
narrative effect with the greatest economy of means that
is consistent with the utmost emphasis, it follows that,
given any single narrative effect&ndash;&ndash;any theme, in other
words, for a short-story&ndash;&ndash;there can be only one best way
to construct the story based upon it. A novel may be
built in any of a multitude of ways; and the selection of
method depends more upon the temperament and taste
of the author than upon inherent logical necessity. But in
a short-story the problem of the author is primarily structural;
and structure is a matter of intellect instead of a
matter of temperament and taste. Now, the intellect
differs from the taste in being an absolute and general,
rather than an individual and personal, quality of mind.
There is no disputing matters of taste, as the Latin
proverb justly says; but matters of intellect may be disputed
logically until a definite decision is arrived at.
Hence, although the planning of a novel must be left to
the individual author, the structure of a short-story may
be considered as a matter impersonal and absolute, like
the working out of a geometrical proposition.</p>
<p><b>Problems of Short-Story Construction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The initial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
problem of the writer of short-stories is to find out by
intellectual means the one best way of constructing the
story that he has to tell; and, in order to solve this problem,
there are many questions he must take up and decide.
First of all, he must conserve the need for economy
of means by considering how many, or rather,
<i>how few</i>, characters are necessary to the narrative, how
few distinct events he can get along with, and how narrow
is the compass of time and place within which he may
compact his material. He must next consider all the
available points of view from which to tell the given story,
and must decide which of them will best subserve his
purpose. Next, in deciding on his means of delineating
characters, of representing action, of employing setting,
he must be guided always by the endeavor to strike a
just balance between (on the one hand) the greatest
economy of means and (on the other) the utmost emphasis.
And finally, to conserve the latter need, he must,
in planning the narrative step by step, be guided by the
principle of emphasis in all its phases.</p>
<p><b>The Initial Position.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The natural emphasis of the
initial and the terminal position is, in the short-story, a
matter of prime importance. The opening of a perfectly
constructed tale fulfills two purposes, one of which is intellectual
and the other emotional. Intellectually, it
indicates clearly to the reader whether, in the narrative
that follows, the element of action, or of character, or of
setting is to be predominant,&ndash;&ndash;in other words, which of
the three sorts of narrative effect the story is intended to
produce. Emotionally, it strikes the key-note and suggests
the tone of the entire story. Edgar Allan Poe, in
his greatest tales, planned his openings infallibly to fulfill
these purposes. He began a story of setting with description;
a story of character with a remark made by,
or made about, the leading actor; and a story of action
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
with a sentence pregnant with potential incident. Furthermore,
he conveyed in his very first sentence a subtle
sense of the emotional tone of the entire narrative.</p>
<p>In opening his short-stories, Hawthorne showed himself
far inferior to his great contemporary. Only unawares
did he occasionally hit upon the inevitable first
sentence. Often he wasted time at the beginning by
writing an unnecessary introduction; and frequently he
began upon the wrong track, by suggesting character at
the outset of a story of action, or suggesting setting at the
outset of a story of character. The tale of &ldquo;The Gentle
Boy,&rdquo; for instance, which was one of the first to attract
attention to his genius, begins unnecessarily with an historical
essay of three pages; and it is not until the narrative
is well on its way that the reader is able to sense the
one thing that it is all about.</p>
<p>Mr. Rudyard Kipling, in his earlier stories, employed
a method of opening which is worthy of careful critical
consideration. In &ldquo;Plain Tales from the Hills&rdquo; and the
several volumes that followed it within the next few years,
his habit was to begin with an expository essay, filling the
space of a paragraph or two, in which he stated the theme
of the story he was about to tell. &ldquo;This is what the story
is to deal with,&rdquo; he would say succinctly: &ldquo;Now listen to
the tale itself.&rdquo; This method is extremely advantageous
on the score of economy. It gives the reader at the outset
an intellectual possession of the theme; and knowing
from the very beginning the effect designed to be produced,
he can follow with the greater economy of attention
the narrative that produces it. But, on the other
hand, the method is inartistic, in that it presents explicitly
what might with greater subtlety be conveyed implicitly,
and subverts the mood of narrative by obtruding exposition.
In his later stories, Mr. Kipling has discarded for
the most part this convenient but too obvious expedient,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
and has revealed his theme implicitly through the narrative
tenor and emotional tone of his initial sentences.
That the latter method of opening is the more artistic
will be seen at once from a comparison of examples.
This is the beginning of &ldquo;Thrown Away,&rdquo; an early story:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To rear a boy under what parents call the &lsquo;sheltered
life system&rsquo; is, if the boy must go into the world and fend
for himself, not wise. Unless he be one in a thousand he
has certainly to pass through many unnecessary troubles;
and may, possibly, come to extreme grief simply from
ignorance of the proper proportions of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let a puppy eat the soap in the bath-room or chew a
newly blacked boot. He chews and chuckles until, by
and by, he finds out that blacking and Old Brown Windsor
made him very sick; so he argues that soap and boots
are not wholesome. Any old dog about the house will
soon show him the unwisdom of biting big dogs&rsquo; ears.
Being young, he remembers and goes abroad, at six
months, a well-mannered little beast with a chastened
appetite. If he had been kept away from boots, and
soap, and big dogs till he came to the trinity full-grown
and with developed teeth, consider how fearfully sick
and thrashed he would be! Apply that notion to the
&lsquo;sheltered life,&rsquo; and see how it works. It does not sound
pretty, but it is the better of two evils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a Boy once who had been brought up
under the &lsquo;sheltered life&rsquo; theory; and the theory killed
him dead....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on. At this point, after the expository introduction,
the narrative proper begins. Consider now the
opening of a later story, &ldquo;Without Benefit of Clergy.&rdquo;
This is the first sentence:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;But if it be a girl?&rdquo; Notice
how much has already been said and suggested in this
little question of six words. Surely the beginning of this
story is conducted with the better art.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>The expository opening was copied from Mr. Kipling
by O. Henry and established by this writer as a fashion
which is still continued by contributors to American
magazines. But a popular expedient is not necessarily
to be regarded as a permanent contribution to the methods
of fiction; and Mr. Kipling, in his later stories, is a
finer artist than Miss Edna Ferber or any other of the
many imitators of O. Henry.</p>
<p><b>The Terminal Position.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But, in the structure of the
short-story, the emphasis of the terminal position is an
even more important matter. In this regard again
Poe shows his artistry, in stopping at the very moment
when he has attained completely his pre&euml;stablished design.
His conclusions remain to this day unsurpassed
in the sense they give of absolute finality. Hawthorne
was far less firm in mastering the endings of his stories.
His personal predilection for pointing a moral to adorn
his tale led him frequently to append a passage of homiletic
comment which was not bone of the bone and blood
of the blood of the narrative itself. In the chapter on
emphasis, we have already called attention to Guy de
Maupassant&rsquo;s device of periodic structure, by means of
which the solution of the story is withheld till the concluding
sentences. This exceedingly effective expedient,
however, is applicable only in the sort of story wherein
the element of surprise is inherent in the nature of the
theme. In no other single feature of construction may
the work of the inexperienced author be so readily detected
as in the final passage of his story. Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lispeth&rdquo; (the first of &ldquo;Plain Tales from the Hills&rdquo;),
which was written at a very early age, began perfectly
[the first word is &ldquo;She&rdquo;] and proceeded well; but when
he approached his conclusion, the young author did not
know where to stop. His story really ended at the words,
&ldquo;And she never came back&rdquo;; for at that point his pre-established
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
design had been entirely effected. But instead
of closing there, he appended four unnecessary
paragraphs, dealing with the subsequent life of his
heroine&ndash;&ndash;all of which was, to use his own familiar phrase,
&ldquo;another story.&rdquo; Poe and de Maupassant would not
have made this mistake; and neither would Mr. Kipling
after he had grown into mastery of artistic method.
In one of the most celebrated stories of O. Henry, entitled
&ldquo;The Gift of the Magi&rdquo;, the author made the technical
mistake of appending a superfluous paragraph after his
logical pattern had been completed.</p>
<p><b>Poe&rsquo;s Analysis of &ldquo;The Raven.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;In his very interesting
paper on &ldquo;The Philosophy of Composition,&rdquo; Edgar
Allan Poe outlined step by step the intellectual processes
by which he developed the structure of &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo;
and fashioned a finished poem from a preconceived effect.
It is greatly to be regretted that he did not write a similar
essay outlining in detail the successive stages in the
construction of one of his short-stories. With his extraordinarily
clear and analytic intellect, he fashioned his
plots with mathematical precision. So rigorously did
he work that in his best stories we feel that the removal
of a sentence would be an amputation. He succeeded
absolutely in giving his narrative the utmost emphasis
with the greatest economy of means.</p>
<p><b>Analysis of &ldquo;Ligeia.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;If we learn through and through
how a single perfect story is constructed, we shall have
gone far toward understanding the technic of story-building
as a whole. Let us therefore analyze one of
Poe&rsquo;s short-stories&ndash;&ndash;following in the main the method
which he himself pursued in his analysis of &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;in
order to learn the successive steps by which any excellent
short-story may be developed from its theme. Let
us choose &ldquo;Ligeia&rdquo; for the subject of this study, because
it is very widely known, and because Poe himself considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
it the greatest of his tales. Let us see how, starting
with the theme of the story, Poe developed step by
step the structure of his finished fabric; and how, granted
his pre&euml;stablished design, the progress of his plan was in
every step inevitable.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<p>The theme of &ldquo;Ligeia&rdquo; was evidently suggested by
those lines from Joseph Glanvill which, quoted as a motto
for the story, are thrice repeated during the course of the
narrative:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who
knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For
God is but a great will, pervading all things by nature of
its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels,
nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness
of his feeble will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poe recognized, with the English moralist, that the
human will is strong and can conquer many of the ills
that flesh is heir to. If it were still stronger, it could do
more mighty things; and if it were <i>very much</i> stronger,
it is even conceivable that it might vanquish death, its
last and sternest foe. Now it was legitimate for the purposes
of fiction to imagine a character endowed with a
will strong enough to conquer death; and a striking narrative
effect could certainly be produced by setting forth
this moral conquest. This, then, became the purpose
of the story: to exhibit a character with a superhuman
will, and to show how, by sheer force of volition, this
person conquered death.</p>
<p>Having thus decided on his theme, the writer of the
story was first forced to consider how many, or rather
<i>how few</i>, characters were necessary to the narrative.
One, at least, was obviously essential,&ndash;&ndash;the person with
the superhuman will. For esthetic reasons Poe made this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
character a woman, and called her Ligeia; but it is evident
that <i>structurally</i> the story would have been the same if
he had made the character a man. The resultant narrative
would have been different in mood and tone; but it
would not have been different in structure. Given this
central character, it was not perhaps evident at first that
another person was needed for the tale. But in all
stories which set forth an extraordinary being, it is necessary
to introduce an ordinary character to serve as a
standard by which the unusual capabilities of the central
figure may be measured. Furthermore, in stories which
treat of the miraculous, it is necessary to have at least one
eye-witness to the extraordinary circumstances beside the
person primarily concerned in them. Hence another
character was absolutely needed in the tale. This second
person, moreover, had to be intimately associated with
the heroine, for the two reasons already considered. The
most intimate relation imaginable was that of husband
and wife; he must therefore be the husband of Ligeia.
Beside these two people,&ndash;&ndash;a woman of superhuman will,
and her husband, a man of ordinary powers,&ndash;&ndash;no other
character was necessary; and therefore Poe did not (and
<i>could not</i>, according to the laws of the short-story) introduce
another. The Lady of Tremaine, as we shall see
later on, is not, technically considered, a character.</p>
<p>The main outline of the story could now be plotted.
Ligeia and her husband must be exhibited to the reader;
and then, in her husband&rsquo;s presence, Ligeia must conquer
death by the vigor of her will. But in order to do
this, she must first die. If she merely exerted her will to
ward off the attacks of death, the reader would not be convinced
that her recovery had been accomplished by other
than ordinary means. She must die, therefore, and must
afterwards resurrect herself by a powerful exertion of
volition. The reader must be fully convinced that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
did really die; and therefore, before her resurrection, she
must be laid for some time in the grave. The story,
then, divided itself into two parts: the first, in which
Ligeia was alive, terminated with her death; and the
second, in which she was dead, ended with her resurrection.</p>
<p>Having thus arrived at the main outline of his plot, Poe
was next forced to decide on the point of view from which
the story should be told. Under the existing conditions,
any one of three distinct points of view may have seemed,
at the first glance, available: that of the chief character,
that of the secondary character, and that of an external
omniscient personality. But only a little consideration
was necessary to show that only one of these three could
successfully be employed. Obviously, the story could
not be narrated by Ligeia: for it would be awkward to
let an extraordinary woman discourse about her own
unusual qualities; and furthermore, she could hardly
narrate a story involving as one of its chief features her
stay among the dead without being expected to tell the
secrets of her prison-house. It was likewise impossible
to tell the tale from the point of view of an external omniscient
personality. In order that the final and miraculous
incident might seem convincing, it had to be narrated not
impersonally but personally, not externally but by an eye-witness.
Therefore, the story must, of course, be told by
the husband of Ligeia.</p>
<p>At this point the main outline was completed. It then
became necessary for Poe to plan the two divisions of the
story in detail. In the first part, no action was necessary,
and very little attention had to be paid to setting. It
was essential that all of the writer&rsquo;s stress should be laid
on the element of character; for the sole purpose of this
initial division of the story must be to produce upon the
reader an extremely emphatic impression of the extraordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
personality of Ligeia. As soon as the reader
could be sufficiently impressed with the force of her character,
she must be made to die; and the first part of the
story would be finished. But at this point Poe was
obliged to choose between the direct and the indirect
means of delineating character. Should Ligeia be
depicted directly by her husband, or indirectly, through
her own speech? In other words, should this first half of
the story be a description or a conversation? The matter
was easy to decide. The method of conversation was
unavailable; because a dialogue between Ligeia and her
husband would keep the attention of the reader hovering
from one to the other, whereas it was necessary for the
purpose of the tale to focus all of the attention on Ligeia.
She must, therefore, be depicted directly by her husband.
Having concluded that he must devote the entire first
half of his story to this description, Poe employed all his
powers to make it adequate and emphatic. The description
must, of course, be largely subjective and suggestive,
and must be pervaded with a sense of something unfathomable
about the person described. In order that
(reverting to the language of Poe&rsquo;s own critical dictum)
&ldquo;his very initial sentence&rdquo; might &ldquo;tend to the outbringing
of this effect,&rdquo; the author wrote, &ldquo;I cannot for my soul
remember how, when, or even precisely where I first
became acquainted with the Lady Ligeia&rdquo;; and the story
was begun.</p>
<p>It was more difficult to handle the second division of
the tale, which was to deal with the period between
Ligeia&rsquo;s death and her resurrection. The main stress of
the story now ceased to be laid on the element of character.
The element of action, furthermore, was subsidiary
in the second part of the tale, as it had been already in
the first. All that had to happen was the resurrection of
Ligeia; and this the reader had been forced by the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
theme of the story to foresee. The chief interest in the
second part must therefore lie in determining where and
when and how this resurrection was accomplished. A
worthy setting must be found for the culminating event.
Poe could lose no time in preparing a place for his climax;
and therefore he was obliged, as soon as he had laid
Ligeia in the grave, to begin an elaborate description of
the stage settings of his final scene. The place must be
wild and weird and arabesque. It must be worthy to
receive a resurrected mortal revisiting the glimpses of the
moon. The place was found, the time&ndash;&ndash;midnight&ndash;&ndash;decided
upon: but the question remained,&ndash;&ndash;<i>how</i> should
Ligeia be resurrected?</p>
<p>And here arose almost an insuperable difficulty. Ligeia
had been buried (<i>must have been</i> buried, as we have seen),
and her body had been given to the worms. Yet now she
must be revived. And it would not be sufficient to let
her merely walk bodily into the fantastic apartment
where her husband, dream-haunted, was waiting to receive
her; for the point to be emphasized was not so
much the mere fact of her being once more alive, as the
fact that she had won her way back to life by the exertion
of her own extraordinary will. The reader must be
shown not only <i>the result</i> of her triumph over death, but
<i>the very process of the struggle</i> through which by sheer
volition she forced her soul back into the bodily life. If
only her body were present, so that the reader could be
shown its gradual obsession by her soul, all would be
easily accomplished; but, by the conditions of the story,
her body <i>could not</i> be present: and the difficulty of the
problem was extreme.</p>
<p>But here Poe hit upon a solution of the difficulty.
Would not another dead body do as well? Surely Ligeia
could breathe her life into any discarded female form.
Therefore, of course, her husband must marry again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
solely in order that his second wife should die. The
Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine is, therefore, as I
have already hinted, not really a character, but only a
necessary adjunct to the final scene, an indispensable
piece of stage property. In order to indicate this fact,
Poe was obliged to abstain carefully from describing her
in detail, and to seek in every possible way to prevent
the reader&rsquo;s attention from dwelling long upon her.
Hence, although, in writing the first part of the story, he
devoted several pages to the description of the heroine, he
dismissed the Lady Rowena, in the second part, with only
two descriptive epithets,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;fair-haired and blue-eyed,&rdquo;
to distinguish her briefly from the dark-eyed and raven-haired
Ligeia.</p>
<p>With the help of this convenient body, it was easy for
Poe to develop his final scene. The intense struggle of
Ligeia&rsquo;s soul to win its way back to the world could be
worked up with enthralling suspense: and when at last
the climax was reached and the husband realized that his
lost love stood living before him, the purpose of the story
would be accomplished, Ligeia&rsquo;s will would have done
its work, and there would be nothing more to tell. Poe
wrote, &ldquo;These are the full, and the black, and the wild
eyes&ndash;&ndash;of my lost love&ndash;&ndash;of the Lady&ndash;&ndash;of the <i>Lady
Ligeia</i>&rdquo;: and the story was ended.</p>
<p>For it must be absolutely understood that with whatever
may have happened after that moment of entire
recognition this particular story does not, and cannot,
concern itself. Whether in the next moment Ligeia dies
again irrevocably, or whether she lives an ordinary lifetime
and then ultimately dies forever, or whether she
remains alive eternally as a result of the triumph of her
will, are questions entirely beyond the scope of the story
and have nothing to do with the single narrative effect
which Poe, from the very outset, was planning to produce.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
At no other point does he more clearly display his mastery
than in his choice of the perfect moment at which to
end his story.</p>
<p>It would, of course, be idle to assert that Poe disposed
of all the narrative problems which confronted him while
constructing this story precisely in the order I have indicated.
Unfortunately, he never explained in print the
genesis of any of his stories, and we can only imagine the
process of his plans with the aid of his careful analysis of
the development of &ldquo;The Raven.&rdquo; But I think it has
been clearly shown that the structure of &ldquo;Ligeia&rdquo; is at all
points inevitably conditioned by its theme, and that no
detail of the structure could be altered without injuring
the effect of the story; and I am confident that some
intellectual process similar to that which has been outlined
must be followed by every author who seeks to construct
stories as perfect in form as Poe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Analysis of &ldquo;The Prodigal Son.&rdquo;</b>&ndash;&ndash;The student of
short-story structure is therefore advised to submit
several other masterpieces of the form to a process of
intellectual analysis similar to that which we have just
pursued. By so doing he will become impressed with
the <i>inevitability</i> of every structural expedient that is
employed in the best examples of the type. For a further
illustration of this inevitability of structure, let us look
for a moment at the parable of &ldquo;The Prodigal Son&rdquo; (Luke
xv., beginning with the eleventh verse), which, although
it was written down many centuries ago, fulfills the
modern critical concept of the short-story, in that it produces
a single narrative effect with the greatest economy
of means that is consistent with the utmost emphasis.
For the purposes of this study, let us set aside the religious
implications of the parable, and consider it as an
ordinary work of fiction. The story should more properly
be called &ldquo;The Forgiving Father,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
Prodigal Son&rdquo;; because the single narrative effect to be
wrought out is the extent of a father&rsquo;s forgiveness toward
his erring children. Two characters are obviously
needed for the tale,&ndash;&ndash;first, a father to exercise forgiveness,
and second, a child to be forgiven. Whether this child
were a son or a daughter would, of course, have no effect
on the mere structure of the story. In the narrative as
we know it, the erring child is a son. In pursuance of the
greatest economy of means, the story might be told with
these two characters only, because the effect to be
wrought out is based on the personal relation between
them,&ndash;&ndash;a relation involving no one else. But fatherly
forbearance exercised toward an <i>only</i> child might seem a
trait of human weakness instead of patriarchal strength;
and the father&rsquo;s forgiveness will be greatly accentuated
if, beside the prodigal, he has other children less liable to
error. Therefore, in pursuance of the utmost emphasis,
it is necessary to add a third character,&ndash;&ndash;another son who
is not allured into the way of the transgressor. The
story must necessarily be narrated by an external omniscient
personality: it must be seen and told from a point
of view aloof and god-like. The father could not tell it,
because the theme of the tale is the beauty of his own
character; and neither of the two sons is in a position to
see the story whole and to narrate it without prejudice.
The story opens perfectly, with the very simple sentence,
&ldquo;A certain man had two sons.&rdquo; Already the reader
knows that he is to be told a story of character (rather
than of action or of setting) concerning three people, the
most important of whom is the certain man who has
been mentioned first. Consider, in passing, how faulty
would have been such another opening as this, for instance,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Not
long ago, in a city of Judea&rdquo;....
Such an initial sentence would have suggested setting,
instead of suggesting character, as the leading element
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
in the story. Very properly, the first of the two sons to
be singled out specifically is the more important of the
two, the prodigal: &ldquo;And the younger of them said to
his father, &lsquo;Father, give me the portion of goods that
falleth to me.&rsquo;&rdquo; Thus, in only two sentences, the reader
is given the entire basis of the story. The swift and
simple narrative that follows is masterly in absolute conciseness.
The younger son takes his journey into a far
country, wastes his substance in riotous living, begins to
be in want, suffers and repents, and returns to seek the
forgiveness of his father. Wonderfully, beautifully, his
father loves and pities and forgives him: &ldquo;For this my son
was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.&rdquo;
At this point the story would end, if it were told with only
two characters instead of three. But emphasis demands
that the elder son should now make an entirely reasonable
objection to the reception of the prodigal; because the
great love which is the essence of the father&rsquo;s character
will shine forth much more brightly when he overrules
the objection. He does so in the same words he had used
in the first moment of emotion: &ldquo;For this thy brother was
dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.&rdquo;
These beautiful words, which now receive the emphasis
of iteration as well as the emphasis of terminal position,
sum up and complete the entire pre&euml;stablished design.</p>
<p>This story, which contains only five hundred words,
is a little masterpiece of structure. It embodies a narrative
theme of profound human import; it exhibits three
characters so clearly and completely drawn that the
reader knows them better than he knows many a hero of
a lengthy novel; and it displays an absolute adjustment
between economy and emphasis in its succinct yet touching
train of incidents. Furthermore, it is also, in the
English version of the King James translators, a little
masterpiece of style. The words are simple, homely, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
direct. Most of them are of Saxon origin, and the majority
are monosyllabic. Less than half a dozen words
in the entire narrative contain more than two syllables.
And yet they are set so delicately together that they fall
into rhythms potent with emotional effect. How much
the story gains from this mastery of prose may be felt at
once by comparing with the King James version parallel
passages from the standard French Bible. The English
monosyllabic refrain, with its touching balance of rhythm,
loses nearly all of its esthetic effect in the French translation:
&ldquo;<i>Car mon fils, que voici, &eacute;tait mort, mais il est ressuscit&eacute;;
il &eacute;tait perdu, mais il est retrouv&eacute;.</i>&rdquo; And that very
moving sentence about the elder son, &ldquo;And he was angry,
and would not go in: therefore came his father out and
entreated him,&rdquo; becomes in the French Bible, &ldquo;<i>Mais il se
mit en col&egrave;re, et ne voulut point entrer; et son p&egrave;re &eacute;tant
sorti, le priait d&rsquo;entrer.</i>&rdquo; No especial nicety of ear is
necessary to notice that the first is greatly written, and
the second is not.</p>
<p><b>Style Essential to the Short-Story.</b>&ndash;&ndash;And this leads us
to the general consideration that even a perfectly constructed
story will fail of the uttermost effect unless it be
at all points adequately written. After Poe had, with
his intellect, outlined step by step the structure of
&ldquo;Ligeia,&rdquo; he was obliged to confront a further problem,&ndash;&ndash;the
problem of writing the story with the thrilling and
enthralling harmony of that low, musical language which
haunts us like the echo of a dream. It is one thing to
build a story; it is quite another thing to write it: and in
Poe&rsquo;s case it is evident that an appreciable interval of
time must have elapsed between his accomplishment of
the first, and his undertaking of the second, effort. He
built his stories intellectually, in cold blood; he wrote
them emotionally, in esthetic exaltation: and the two
moods are so distinct and mutually exclusive that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
must have been successive instead of coexistent. Some
authors build better than they write; others write better
than they build. Seldom, very seldom, is a man equipped,
as Poe was, with an equal mastery of structure and
of style. Yet though unity of form may be attained
through structure alone, unity of mood is dependent
mainly upon style. The language should be pitched
throughout in tune with the emotional significance of the
narrative effect to be produced. Any sentence which is
tuned out of harmony will jangle and disrupt the unity
of mood, which is as necessary to a great short-story as
it is to a great lyric poem. Hawthorne, though his structure
was frequently at fault, proved the greatness of his
art by maintaining, through sheer mastery of style, an
absolute unity of mood in every story that he undertook.
Mr. Kipling has not always done so, because he has
frequently used language more with manner than with
style; but in his best stories, like &ldquo;The Brushwood
Boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;They,&rdquo; there is a unity of tone throughout
the writing that sets them on the plane of highest art.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Structure and Style.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The element of style, which
has just been touched upon in reference to the short-story,
must now be considered in its broader aspect as a
factor of fiction in general. Hitherto, in examining the
methods of fiction, we have confined our attention for the
most part to the study of structural expedients. The
reason is that structure, being a matter merely of the
intellect, can be analyzed clearly and expounded definitely.
Like any other intellectual subject&ndash;&ndash;geometry,
for instance&ndash;&ndash;structure may be taught. But style,
although it is in fiction a factor scarcely less important,
is not a matter merely of the intellect. It is not so
easily permissible of clear analysis and definite exposition;
and although it is true that, in a certain sense, it
may be learned, it is also true that it cannot be taught.</p>
<p><b>Style a Matter of Feeling.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The word &ldquo;style&rdquo; comes
trippingly to the tongue of every critic; but it has never
yet been satisfactorily defined. Famous phrases have
been made about it, to be sure; but most of these, like
that corrupted from Buffon&rsquo;s cursory remark in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
discourse of reception into the Academy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>Le style est de
l&rsquo;homme m&ecirc;me</i>,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;are lofty admissions of the impossibility
of definition. By this fact we are fortified in our
opinion that style is a matter of feeling rather than of
intellect. Avoiding, therefore, as unwise any attempt
at definition, we may yet succeed in clarifying our ideas
regarding style if we circle round the subject.</p>
<p><b>Style an Absolute Quality.</b>&ndash;&ndash;At the outset, in order to
narrow the compass of the circle, let us admit that the
familiar phrase &ldquo;bad style&rdquo; is a contradiction of terms.
Basically, there is no such thing as good style or bad.
Either a literary utterance is made with style, or else it
is made without it. This initial distinction is absolute,
not relative. It must, however, be admitted that of two
utterances made with style, the one may be more imbued
with that quality than is the other; but even this
secondary distinction is a matter of more and less, rather
than of better and worse. Style, then, is a quality possessed
in a greater or less degree, or else not possessed at
all. This much being granted, we may investigate with
clearer minds the philosophic aspect of the subject.</p>
<p><b>The Twofold Appeal of Language.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Language makes
to the mind of the reader or the listener an appeal which
is twofold. First, it conveys to his intellect a definite
meaning through the content of the words that are
employed; and secondly, it conveys to his sensibilities an
indefinite suggestion through their sound. Consciously,
he receives a meaning from the denotation of the words;
subconsciously, he receives a suggestion from their connotation.
Now, an utterance has the quality of style
when these two appeals of language&ndash;&ndash;the denotative and
the connotative, the definite and the indefinite, the
intellectual and the sensuous&ndash;&ndash;are so co&ouml;rdinated as to
produce upon the reader or the listener an effect which is,
not dual, but indissolubly single. And an utterance is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
devoid of the quality of style when, although it conveys
a meaning to the intellect through the content of the
words, it does not reinforce that conveyance of meaning
by a cognate and harmonic appeal to the senses through
their sound. In the latter case the language produces
upon the recipient an effect which is, not single, but dual
and divorced.</p>
<p><b>Concrete Examples.</b>&ndash;&ndash;The matter may be made more
clear by the examination of concrete examples. The
following sentence, for instance, is devoid of style: &ldquo;The
square on the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle is
equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides&rdquo;:
for, although by its content it conveys to the intellect a
meaning which is entirely clear and absolutely definite,
it does not by its sound convey to the senses a suggestion
which is cognate. But, on the other hand, the following
lines from Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Princess&rdquo; are rich in style,
because the appeals to the intellect and to the ear are so
co&ouml;rdinated as to produce a single simultaneous effect:&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro&rsquo; the lawn,<br />
The moan of doves in immemorial elms,<br />
And murmuring of innumerable bees.&rdquo;

</td></tr></table>

<p>In these lines, fully as much is conveyed to the reader by
the mere melody of m&rsquo;s and r&rsquo;s and l&rsquo;s as by the content,
or denotation, of the words. For instance, the word
&ldquo;innumerable,&rdquo; which denotes to the intellect merely
&ldquo;incapable of being numbered,&rdquo; is in this connection
made to suggest to the senses the murmuring of bees.
That one word, therefore, accomplishes a dual service,
and contributes to the expression of the general idea in
one way through its content and in another through its
sound.</p>
<p><b>Onomatopoetic Words.</b>&ndash;&ndash;This co&ouml;rdination of the two
appeals is the origin and the essence of the quality of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
style. But the question now demands to be considered,&ndash;&ndash;<i>how</i>
may this co&ouml;rdination be effected? The first
detail we must attend to is the choice of words. Tennyson&rsquo;s
task, in the lines that we have just considered, was
comparatively easy. He was writing about certain
sounds; and it was not especially difficult for him to
imitate those sounds with the words that he selected to
denote them. His device was the obvious one which is
called, by rhetoricians, onomatop&oelig;ia. In every language
those words which are denotative of sounds are
nearly always also imitative of them. Such words, as,
for example, &ldquo;whisper,&rdquo; &ldquo;thunder,&rdquo; &ldquo;rattle,&rdquo; are in
themselves stylistic. Alone, and apart from any context,
they incorporate that cognate appeal of significance and
sound which is the secret of style. Thus far the matter
is extremely simple. But there are also many words
which denote other things than sounds and yet somehow
convey subtly to the ear a sensuous suggestion of
their content. Such words, for instance, are &ldquo;mud,&rdquo;
&ldquo;nevermore,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tremulous.&rdquo; Any child could tell
you that words like these &ldquo;sound just like what they
mean&rdquo;; and yet it would be impossible for the critical
intellect to explain exactly wherein lies the fitness between
sound and sense in such a word as &ldquo;mud.&rdquo; The
fitness, however, is obviously there. If we select from
several languages words which are identical in denotation,
we are likely to find that, because of their difference in
sound, they connote different phases of the idea which
they contain. For example, the English word &ldquo;death&rdquo;
has a spiritual sound; whereas the German &ldquo;<i>der Tod</i>&rdquo;
sounds horrible and grim, and the French &ldquo;<i>la mort</i>&rdquo;
sounds fearsome and bizarre. In content, these three
words are indistinguishable; but in style they differ very
widely. Their diversity of connotation is obviously inherent
in their sound; and yet, though the difference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
may be heard at once, it seems inexplicable by the intellect.</p>
<p><b>Memorable Words.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But by far the greatest number
of stylistic words owe their connotation not so much to
their sound alone, as to their capacity for evoking memories.
They awake the psychologic process of association.
Such are the words which lie close to the heart
of every one&rsquo;s experience,&ndash;&ndash;words like &ldquo;home,&rdquo; &ldquo;sorrow,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;youth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; Whenever
such a word is used, it conveys to the reader or the listener
not only the specific meaning intended by the momentary
context, but also a subsidiary and subconscious recollection
of many phases of his personal experience. All of
the indisputably magic words possess this associative
or <i>memorable</i> quality. Saying one thing definitely, they
evoke a concordant harmony of subconscious and shadowy
suggestion. Expressing a message in the present, they
recall remembered beauty from the past. Thus it is
with the words of those two enchanted lines of Keats,&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Charm&rsquo;d magic casements, opening on the foam<br />
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.&rdquo;
</p></td></tr></table>

<p>They say much more than what they say. Conveying
one meaning to the reader, they remind him of many,
many others.</p>
<p><b>The Patterning of Syllables.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But the choice of suggestive
and memorable words is only the first step toward
mastery of style. The perfect marriage of significance
and sound is dependent not so much upon the words
themselves as upon the way in which they are arranged.
The art of style, like every other art, proceeds by an
initial selection of materials and a subsequent arrangement
of them in accordance with a pattern. In style,
the pattern is of prime importance; and therefore, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
order to understand the witchery of writing, we must
next consider technically the patterning of words.</p>
<p><b>Stevenson on Style.</b>&ndash;&ndash;This phase of the subject has
been clearly expounded and deftly illustrated by Robert
Louis Stevenson in his essay &ldquo;On Some Technical Elements
of Style in Literature.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> This essay is, so far as
I know, the only existing treatise on the technic of style
which is of any practical value to the incipient artist.
It should therefore be read many times and mastered
thoroughly by every student of the mystery of writing.
Since it is now easily accessible, it will not be necessary
here to do more than summarize its leading points,&ndash;&ndash;stating
them in a slightly different way in order that
they may better fit the present context.</p>
<p><b>The Pattern of Rhythm.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Every normal sentence,
unless it be extremely brief, contains a knot, or hitch.
Up to a certain point, the thought is progressively complicated;
after that, it is resolved. Now, the art of style
demands that this natural implication and explication of
the thought should be attended by a cognate implication
and explication of the movement of the sentence. Unless
the hitch in the rhythm coincides with the hitch in the
thought, the two appeals of the sentence (to the intellect
and to the ear) will contest against each other instead
of combining to accomplish a common effect. Therefore
the first necessity in weaving a web of words is to conquer
an accordance between the intellectual progression
of the thought and the sensuous progression of the
sound. The appeal of rhythm to the human ear is
basic and elemental; and style depends for its effect more
upon a mastery of rhythmic phrase than upon any other
individual detail. In verse, the technical problem is
twofold: first, to suggest to the ear of the reader a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
rhythmic pattern of standard regularity; and then, to
vary from the regularity suggested, as deftly and as
frequently as may be possible without ever allowing the
reader for a moment to forget the fundamental pattern.
In prose, the writer works with greater freedom; and his
problem is therefore at once more easy and more difficult.
Instead of starting with a standard pattern, he has to
invent a web of rhythm which is suited to the sense he
wishes to convey; and then, without ever disappointing
the ear of the reader by unnecessarily withholding an
expected fall of rhythm, he must shatter every inkling
of monotony by continual and tasteful variation.</p>
<p><b>The Pattern of Literation.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But language, by its very
nature, offers to the ear not only a pattern of rhythm but
also a pattern of letters. A mastery of literation is
therefore a necessary element of style. Effects indisputably
potent in suggestion may be gained by running
a recurrence of certain letters, deftly for a time withheld,&ndash;&ndash;since
blatancy must always be avoided,&ndash;&ndash;yet triumphant
in harmonious return. The great sentences of
literature which echo in our ears because their sound is
married to their meaning will be found upon examination
to incorporate an intricate pattern of tastefully
selected letters. Thus it is with the following sentence
of Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s, wherein it is difficult to decide
whether the rhythm or the literation contributes the
larger share to its symmetry of sound:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;But the
iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy, and
deals with the memory of men without distinction to
merit of perpetuity.&rdquo; Thus it is, again, with this
sentence from Ruskin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seven Lamps of Architecture&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;They
are but the rests and monotones of the
art; it is to its far happier, far higher, exaltation that we
owe those fair fronts of variegated mosaic, charged with
wild fancies and dark hosts of imagery, thicker and quainter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
than ever filled the depths of midsummer dream;
those vaulted gates, trellised with close leaves; those
window-labyrinths of twisted tracery and starry light;
those misty masses of multitudinous pinnacle and diademed
tower; the only witnesses, perhaps, that remain to
us of the faith and fear of nations.&rdquo; So it is also with
these sentences from De Quincey&rsquo;s &ldquo;The English Mail-Coach&rdquo;:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The
sea, the atmosphere, the light, bore
each an orchestral part in this universal lull. Moonlight,
and the first timid tremblings of the dawn, were
by this time blending; and the blendings were brought
into a still more exquisite state of unity by a slight silvery
mist, motionless and dreamy, that covered the woods
and fields, but with a veil of equable transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Style a Fine Art.</b>&ndash;&ndash;A more detailed study of style
along these lines would lead us to considerations too
minutely technical for the purpose of the present volume.
Style, in its highest development, belongs only to the
finest art of literature; and it must be admitted that
literature is not always, nor even perhaps most frequently,
a fine art. Of the four rhetorical moods, or
methods, of discourse, exposition lends itself the least to
the assistance of the quality of style. Explanations are
communicated from intellect to intellect. Words, in
exposition, must be chosen chiefly with a view to definite
denotation. The expository writer must be clear at any
cost; he must aim to be precise rather than to be suggestive.
Style is considerably more important as an
adjunct to argumentation; since in order really to persuade,
a writer must not only convince the reader&rsquo;s
intellect but also rouse and conquer his emotions. But
it is in narrative and in description that the quality of
style is most contributive to the maximum effect. To
evoke a picture in the reader&rsquo;s mind, or to convey to his
consciousness a sense of movement, it is advisable (I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
tempted to say necessary) to play upon his sensibilities
with the sound of the very sentences that are framed to
convey a content to his intellect.</p>
<p><b>Style an Important Aid to Fiction.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Since narrative
is the natural mood of fiction, and since description is
more often introduced than either argument or exposition,
it follows that the writer of fiction must always reckon
with the factor of style. It is true that stories may be
written without style; it is even true that many of the
greatest stories have been devoid of this indefinable
quality: but it is not therefore logical to argue that the
factor of style may be neglected. How much it may be
made to contribute to the attainment of the aim of fiction
will be recognized instinctively upon examination of any
wonderfully written passage. Let us consider, for
example, the following paragraphs from &ldquo;Markheim.&rdquo;
After Markheim has killed the dealer, and gone upstairs
to ransack the belongings of the murdered man, he
suffers an interval of quietude amid alarms.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the tail of his eye he saw the door&ndash;&ndash;even
glanced at it from time to time directly, like a besieged
commander pleased to verify the good estate of his defenses.
But in truth he was at peace. The rain falling
in the street sounded natural and pleasant. Presently,
on the other side, the notes of a piano were wakened to
the music of a hymn, and the voices of many children
took up the air and words. How stately, how comfortable
was the melody! How fresh the youthful
voices! Markheim gave ear to it smilingly, as he sorted
out the keys; and his mind was thronged with answerable
ideas and images; church-going children and the pealing
of the high organ; children afield, bathers by the brookside,
ramblers on the brambly common, kite-fliers in the
windy and cloud-navigated sky; and then, at another
cadence of the hymn, back again to church, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
somnolence of summer Sundays, and the high genteel
voice of the parson (which he smiled a little to recall)
and the painted Jacobean tombs, and the dim lettering
of the Ten Commandments in the chancel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as he sat thus, at once busy and absent, he was
startled to his feet. A flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting
gush of blood, went over him, and then he stood
transfixed and thrilling. A step mounted the stair
slowly and steadily, and presently a hand was laid upon
the knob, and the lock clicked, and the door opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anybody who has ears to hear will immediately appreciate
how much the effect of this passage is enhanced by
the masterly employment of every phase of style which
we have hitherto discussed. If, instead of writing,
&ldquo;Presently the notes of a piano were wakened to the
music of a hymn,&rdquo; Stevenson had written, &ldquo;Soon a piano
began to play a hymn,&rdquo; he would have suggested to the
ear a jangle like the banging of tin pans, instead of the
measured melody he had in mind. And let it be particularly
noted that the phrase suggested for comparison is,
<i>in intellectual content alone</i>, scarcely distinct from the
original. How little is the difference in denotation, how
great the difference in suggestion! The brief phrase,
&ldquo;Kite-fliers in the windy and cloud-navigated sky,&rdquo;
seems to blow us bodily upward into the air:&ndash;&ndash;here is
mastery of rhythm. &ldquo;The somnolence of summer Sundays,&rdquo;
is whispery and murmurous with s&rsquo;s, m&rsquo;s, and n&rsquo;s:&ndash;&ndash;here
(more obviously) is mastery of literation. In the
second paragraph, notice how the rhythm suddenly
hurries when Markheim is startled to his feet; and in the
last sentence, consider the monotonous and measured
slowness of the movement, ominous with pauses.</p>
<p><b>The Heresy of the Accidental.</b>&ndash;&ndash;Every now and then
a critic steps forward with the statement that style in
fiction is not a deliberate and conscious conquest, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
the sound of sentences is accidental and may therefore
not be marshaled to contribute to the sense, and that
preoccupation with details of rhythm and of literation
is an evidence of a finical and narrow mind. To such a
statement no answer is necessary but the wholesome
advice to re-read, aloud and carefully, several passages
on a par with that from &ldquo;Markheim&rdquo; which we have
just examined. Very evidently Stevenson knew intuitively
what he was about when he planned his rhythmic
patterns and his literate orchestral harmonies.</p>
<p><b>Style An Intuitive Quality.</b>&ndash;&ndash;I say &ldquo;intuitively,&rdquo;
because, as I admitted at the outset, style is, with the
author, a matter of feeling rather than of intellect. But
matters may be planned with sensibility as well as with
intelligence. The writer with the gift of style forehears
a rhythmic pattern into which he weaves such words as
may be denotative of his thought; and all the while that
he is striving to be definite and clear, he carries in his
mind a subtle sense of the harmonic accompaniment of
consonants, the melodious eloquence of vowels.</p>
<p>By what means a writer may attain to mastery of style
is a question not to be answered by the intellect. Matters
of sensibility are personal, and every man must
solve them for himself. The author of &ldquo;Markheim,&rdquo; as
he tells us in his essay on &ldquo;A College Magazine,&rdquo; taught
himself to write by playing the sedulous ape to many
masters; and this method may be recommended to aspirants
with an imitative ear. But there can be no
general rule; because, although in the process of pure
reason all men rightly minded think alike, each man
differs from every other in the process of emotion.</p>
<p>This is the reason why style, besides being (as we
asserted at the outset) an absolute quality, possessed or
not possessed by any literary utterance, is also in every
case a quality personal to the author who attains it. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
this regard, Buffon was right in stating that style is a
phase of the man himself. Any work that is accomplished
by the intellect alone belongs to man in general
rather than to one man in particular; but any work that
is accomplished by the sensibilities incorporates those
profounder qualities by virtue of which each man stands
distinct from every other. By studying the structure
of an author&rsquo;s work, we can estimate his intellect: by
studying the style, we can estimate that subtler entity
which is the man himself.</p>
<p><b>Methods and Materials.</b>&ndash;&ndash;At the close of our study of
the materials and methods of fiction, it is advisable that
we should consider in general the relation between form
and content,&ndash;&ndash;the respective value of methods and materials.
Primarily, there are two groups of worthy fiction,&ndash;&ndash;that
which is great mainly on account of its content,
and that which is great mainly on account of its
form. It would be unwise, of course, to overestimate the
single and inherent value of either material or method.
Some comparison, however, may be made between the
merits of the one group and the other.</p>
<p><b>Content and Form.</b>&ndash;&ndash;In the first place, it must be
noted that, as far as the general reader is concerned, the
appeal of any work of fiction depends far more upon
its content than upon its form. The average reader
knows little and cares less about the technical methods
of the art. What he demands above all is interesting
subject-matter. He seeks, in the popular phrase, &ldquo;a
good story&rdquo;; he wishes to be told interesting things
about interesting people; and he does not feel especially
concerned about the question whether or not these
things are told him in an interesting way. The matter,
rather than the manner, is the element that most allures
him.</p>
<p>There are many reasons that tempt the critic to accept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
without reservation the general reader&rsquo;s view. For instance,
many of the most important works of fiction have
been inefficient in mere art. The &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; of
Cervantes is indubitably one of the very greatest novels
in all literature, for the reason that it contains so vast a
world. Yet it is very faulty both in structure and in
style. The author seems to have built it little by little,
as he went along; and he changed his plan so often during
the process of construction that the resultant edifice, like
the cathedral of St. Peter&rsquo;s, is architecturally incoherent.
He showed so little regard for unity that he did not hesitate
to halt his novel for half a hundred pages while he
set before the reader the totally extraneous novelette of
&ldquo;The Curious Impertinent,&rdquo; which he happened to find
lying idle in his desk. How little he was a master of mere
style may be felt at once by comparing his plays with
those of Calderon. Yet these technical considerations do
not count against the value of his masterpiece. All of
Spain is there resumed and uttered, all pains that the
idealist in any age must suffer, all the pity and the glory
of aspiration misapplied.</p>
<p>Scott has no style, and Thackeray has no structure;
but these technical defects go down before their magnitude
of message. Scott teaches us the glory and the
greatness of being healthy, young, adventurous, and
happy; and Thackeray, with tears in his eyes that humanize
the sneer upon his lips, teaches us that the thing we
call Society, with a capital S, is but a vanity of vanities.
If we turn from the novel to the short-story, we shall notice
that certain themes are in themselves so interesting
that the resultant story could not fail to be effective even
were it badly told. It is perhaps unfair to take as an
example Mr. F. J. Stimson&rsquo;s tale called &ldquo;Mrs. Knollys,&rdquo;
because his story is both correctly constructed and beautifully
written; but merely in theme this tale is so effective
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
that it could have endured a less accomplished handling.
The story runs as follows:<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a>&ndash;&ndash;A girl and her husband, both
of whom are very young, go to the Alps for their honeymoon.
The husband, in crossing a glacier, falls into a
crevasse. His body cannot immediately be recovered;
but Mrs. Knollys learns from a German scientist who is
making a study of the movement of the ice that in forty-five
years the body will be carried to the end of the glacier.
Thereafter she regards her husband as absent
but not lost, and lives her life in continuous imagined
communion with him. At the end of the allotted time,
she returns and finds his body. She is then a woman in
her sixties; but her husband is, in aspect, still a boy of
twenty-one. She has dreamt of him as growing old beside
her: she finds him sundered from her by half a century
of change.&ndash;&ndash;Even in a bald and ineffective summary
the interest of this narrative effect must be apparent.
The story scarcely needed to be told so well as Mr.
Stimson told it.</p>
<p>We must admit, then, that, from the standpoint of the
author as well as from that of the general reader, material
may often be regarded as more important than method.
But the critic is not therefore justified in stating that
style and structure may be neglected with impunity.
Other things being equal, the books that have lived the
longest are those which have been executed with admirable
art. The decline in the fame of Fenimore Cooper is
a case in point. Merely in subject-matter, his books are
more important now than they were at the time of their
original publication; for the conditions of life in the
forest primeval must necessarily assume a more especial
interest to a world that, in its immediate experience, is
rapidly forgetting them. But Cooper wrote very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
carelessly and very badly; and as we advance to a finer
appreciation of the art of fiction, we grow more and
more distracted from the contemplation of his message
by his preposterous inequalities of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Novels like the &ldquo;Leatherstocking Tales&rdquo; may be most
enjoyed (I had almost said appreciated best) by readers
with an undeveloped sense of art. This would seem a
very strange admission at the close of a study devoted to
the art of fiction, were it not for the existence of that
other group of stories whose importance lies in method
even more than in material. A lesser thing done perfectly
is often more significant than a bigger thing done
badly. Jane Austen is likely to live longer than George
Eliot, because she conveyed her message, less momentous
though it were, with a finer and a firmer art. Jane Austen&rsquo;s
subjects seem, at the first glance, to be of very small
account. From English middle-class society she selects
a group of people who are in no regard remarkable, and
thereafter concerns herself chiefly with the simple question
of who will ultimately marry whom. But by sedulously
dwelling on the non-essentials of life, she contrives
to remind the reader of its vast essentials. By talking to
us skilfully about the many things that do not matter,
she suggests to us, inversely and with unobtrusive irony,
the few things that really do. Her very message, therefore,
is immediately dependent upon her faultless art. If
she had done her work less well, the result would have
been non-significant and wearisome.</p>
<p>Poe and de Maupassant are shining examples of the
class of authors who are destined to live by their art
alone. Poe, in his short-stories, said nothing of importance
to the world; and de Maupassant said many matters
which might more decorously have remained untalked of.
But the thing they meant to do, they did unfalteringly;
and perfect workmanship is in itself a virtue in this world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
of shoddy compromise and ragged effort. Long after
people have ceased to care for battle, murder, and sudden
death, the thrill and urge of buoyant adventure,
they will re-read the boyish tales of Stevenson for the
sake of their swiftness of propulsion and exultant eloquence
of style.</p>
<p>And fully to appreciate this class of fiction, some technical
knowledge of the art is necessary. Washington
Irving&rsquo;s efforts must, to a great extent, be lost on readers
who are lacking in the ear for style. He had very little
to say,&ndash;&ndash;merely that the Hudson is beautiful, that the
greatest sadness upon earth arises from the early death
of one we love, that laughter and tears are at their deepest
indistinguishable, and that it is very pleasant to sit before
the fire of an old baronial hall and remember musingly;
but he said this little like a gentleman,&ndash;&ndash;with a charm, a
grace, an easy urbanity of demeanor, that set his work
forever in the class of what has been well done by good
and faithful servants.</p>
<p>There is a very fine pleasure in watching with awareness
the doing of things that are done well. Hence, even
for the casual reader, it is advisable to study the methods
of fiction in order to develop a more refined delight in
reading. It would seem that a detective story, in which
the interest is centred mainly in the long withholding of
a mystery, would lose its charm for a reader to whom its
secret has been once revealed. But the reader with a
developed consciousness of method finds an interest evermore
renewed in returning again and again to Poe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Murders in the Rue Morgue.&rdquo; After his first surprise
has been abated, he can enjoy more fully the deftness of
the author&rsquo;s art. After he has viewed the play from a
stall in the orchestra, he may derive another and a different
interest by watching it from the wings. To use a
familiar form of words, Jane Austen is the novelist&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
novelist, Stevenson the writer&rsquo;s writer, Poe the builder&rsquo;s
builder; and in order fully to appreciate the work of
artists such as these, it is necessary (in Poe&rsquo;s words) to
&ldquo;contemplate it with a kindred art.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Fusion of Both Elements.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But the critic should
not therefore be allured into setting method higher than
material and overestimating form at the expense of content.
The ideal to be striven for in fiction is such an intimate
interrelation between the thing said and the way
of saying it that neither may be contemplated apart
from the other. We are touching now upon a third and
smaller group of fiction, which combines the special merits
of the two groups already noted. Such a novel as &ldquo;The
Scarlet Letter,&rdquo; such a short-story as &ldquo;The Brushwood
Boy,&rdquo; belong in this third and more extraordinary class.
What Hawthorne has to say is searching and profound,
and he says it with an equal mastery of structure and of
style. &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter&rdquo; would be great because of
its material alone, even had its author been a bungler;
it would be great because of its art alone, even had he
been less humanly endowed with understanding. But
it is greater as we know it, in its absolute commingling
of the two great merits of important subject and commensurate
art.</p>
<p><b>The Author&rsquo;s Personality.</b>&ndash;&ndash;But in studying &ldquo;The
Scarlet Letter&rdquo; we are conscious of yet another element
of interest,&ndash;&ndash;an interest derived from the personality of
the author. The same story told with equal art by some
one else would interest us very differently. And now we
are touching on still another group of worthy fiction.
Many stories endure more because of the personality of
the men who wrote them than because of any inherent
merit of material or method. Charles Lamb&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dream-Children;
A Revery,&rdquo; which, although it is numbered
among the &ldquo;Essays of Elia,&rdquo; may be regarded as a short-story,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
is important mainly because of the nature of the
man who penned it,&ndash;&ndash;a man who, in an age infected with
the fever of growing up, remained at heart a little child,
looking upon the memorable world with eyes of wonder.</p>
<p><b>Recapitulation.</b>&ndash;&ndash;These, then, are the three merits to
be striven for in equal measure by aspirants to the art
of fiction: momentous material, masterly method, and
important personality. To discover certain truths of
human life that are eminently worth the telling, to
embody them in imagined facts with a mastery both of
structure and of style, and, behind and beyond the work
itself, to be all the time a person worthy of being listened
to: this is, for the fiction-writer, the ultimate ideal.
Seldom, very seldom, have these three contrarious conditions
revealed themselves in a single author; seldom,
therefore, have works of fiction been created that are
absolutely great. It would be difficult for the critic to
select off-hand a single novel which may be accepted in
all ways as a standard of the highest excellence. But if
the term <i>fiction</i> be regarded in its broadest significance,
it may be considered to include the one greatest work of
art ever fashioned by the mind of man. The &ldquo;Divine
Comedy&rdquo; is supreme in subject-matter. The facts of
its cosmogony have been disproved by modern science,
the religion of which it is the monument has fallen into
disbelief, the nation and the epoch that it summarizes
have been trampled under the progress of the centuries;
but in central and inherent truth, in its exposition of
the struggle of the beleaguered human soul to win its
way to light and life, it remains perennial and new. It
is supreme in art. With unfaltering and undejected
effort the master-builder upreared in symmetry its century
of cantos; with faultless eloquence he translated into
song all moods the human heart has ever known. And
it is supreme in personality; because in every line of it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
we feel ourselves in contact with the vastest individual
mind that ever yet inhabited the body of a man. We
know (to quote the Poet&rsquo;s most appreciative translator)&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;from what agonies of heart and brain,<br />
What exultations trampling on despair,<br />
What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,<br />
What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,<br />
Uprose this poem of the earth and air,<br />
This medieval miracle of song.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>His labor kept him lean for twenty years; and many a
time he learned how salt his food who fares upon another&rsquo;s
bread,&ndash;&ndash;how steep his path who treadeth up and down
another&rsquo;s stairs. But Dante saw and conquered,&ndash;&ndash;realizing
what he had to do, knowing how to do it, being
worthy of his work. Therefore, singly among authors,
he deserves the epithet his countrymen apply to him,&ndash;&ndash;divine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Divine Comedy&rdquo; is the supreme epic of the world.
The supreme novel remains to be written. It is doubtful
if human literary art may attain completeness more than
once. But as our authors labor to embody truths of
human life in arranged imagined facts, they should constantly
be guided and inspired by the allurement of the
ultimate ideal. The noblest work is evermore accomplished
by followers of the gleam. Let us, in parting
company, paraphrase the sense of a remark made centuries
ago by Sir Philip Sidney,&ndash;&ndash;that model of a scholar
and a gentleman:&ndash;&ndash;It is well to shoot our arrows at the
moon; for though they may miss their mark, they will yet
fly higher than if we had flung them into a bush.</p>
